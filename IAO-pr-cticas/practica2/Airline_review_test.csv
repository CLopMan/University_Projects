"Adria Airways";5;"Adria Airways customer review";"1st June 2014";"FALSO";"I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their web-site. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.";;;"Economy Class";;;40;40;10;;0;;30;"yes"

I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you don't have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. It's a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.";;;"Business Class";;;40;30;40;;10;;40;"yes"

It was the first routing on Aeroflot for me in many years and I was keen to see if and how their product has changed over time. I had flown the Route VIE-SVO-BAX a week before as well. All sectors were operated by Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the planes seemed to be in very good condition from outside and in the cabin. Leg room was very good for economy class, the flight attendants were helpful and service was done in a professional manner. On the flight from Moscow to Vienna several passengers who were influenced by alcohol already when they boarded became a nuisance to all others. They disturbed other guests  and started to threaten their neighbours after landing in Vienna. The crew did not react to this and even sold alcohol to them.

This flight proved that Aeroflot offers very good service! We could choose from three options for breakfast and, trust me, it was delicious! The aircraft was just fine and the seats comfortable. The staff are nice but could chill and smile just a little more. Or maybe it is my approach to service. Also, if I check in online, having to wait on a long queue at the airport just to drop off doesn’t make much sense nowadays.

The flights were closer to being on time than I experienced with other airlines down here, and basically everything went off without problems. The Austral flights were actually better - the Embraer planes are more comfortable and roomy than Aerolineas Argentinas 737s (which looked new but were a bit cramped) and the Embraer seats even have small entertainment screens (can be hard to get earphones though).

"Aerolineas Argentinas";8;"Aerolineas Argentinas customer review";"14th January 2015";"FALSO";"December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it. When this airline makes mistakes they make up for it.";;;"Business Class";;;40;50;50;;40;;50;"yes"

The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good.

First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid .

One has to understand that traveling with small kids is not easy let alone with twins! Cabin staff first spoke to us rudely because we had left our folded prams on the tarmac as we didn’t have free hands to bring it up since the flight did not have an aero bridge but stairs. I respect rules but there is a manner to convey the message and it cannot be rude! I did not expect her to carry my bags/prams but I do expect some understanding and courtesy. Secondly, when I requested her to clear the food tray so that my toddler wouldn’t make a mess she seemed to have a problem with that too and was sulky when I insisted. Clearly she didn’t get the memo that in a service oriented industry customer is king I would give the person the benefit of doubt had she been new to this but she is the cabin manager and I expect better behavior from someone like that.";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Abu Dhabi to Cochin";2023-01-03 00:00:00;30;10;30;20;;;30;"yes"

Seats were comfortable, spacious and with a reasonable recline. Food was good and well presented. In flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection. Cabin service was a little hit and miss - I asked for wine with my meal and by the time I realised that it had been forgotten I had finished and did not ask for it. The cabin crew spoke reasonable/good English but only spoke to me in Russian because initially I had spoken to them in Russian. The check in in St Petersburg was fast, efficient and in English. They had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane. The flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in Almaty. The Almaty - Bangkok sector was a night flight on a new Dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 2.30 am. Check in in Almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers. (It would have been faster to use the economy check in counter)!

"Air Canada";6;"'''Dinner service was a bit shambolic'''";"4th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"'  Late departing Montreal which, according to the captain during an announcement, was because some meals still needed to be loaded on board. Chief Purser later told me that ''there are bunch of things that we didn't get today'' which means that us, the passengers, won't have those. Dinner service was a bit shambolic with the cabin crew in business class seeming uncoordinated and disjointed. My main course arrived barely warm, so I asked that it be heated up again. It returned quite some time later dried out. It certainly wasn't a meal I'd have expected in a premium cabin on a major carrier. What I have learned about this particular route is that the back of the business cabin is preferred by some customers who have their adult children sitting in the next cabin back (Premium Economy) such that the adult child can frequently come up to the business cabin to check on their elderly parent. I met a Premium Economy passenger in the second J class galley who said he booked his elderly parent's seat that way in order to be able to check on them during the flight. What this means for other passengers is a constant flow of people coming from Premium Economy to check on ''mummy'' up in business class. It makes the cabin feel busy and noisy and one has to endure great long chats between adult child and hard-of-hearing mummy about how to maneuver mommy's seat, etc. I have about eight such passengers around me and feel like I'm in a flying nursing home.'";"Boeing 787-9";"Solo Leisure";"Business Class";"Montreal to Delhi";2023-01-07 00:00:00;30;40;20;50;40;40;30;"yes"

Numerous comments and reviews and without question the majority of those comments / reviews were negative. I flew from my home in Kelowna (central B.C.) to Edmonton then to Toronto on an A321. I was pleasantly surprised by this aircraft, spotlessly clean and the seating (I was in regular economy for this part of my trip ) was spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were delightful, quite young and very friendly and efficient, service was very good. The next part of my trip was Toronto to Glasgow, an evening flight on an older Boeing 767, I was in premium economy. There was a separate cabin for premium economy, I had two large seats to myself. The food was excellent, a lovely meal served with a nice imported red wine, service was top class, well done ladies! On these older 767's there is no in flight entertainment, that is simply an issue that you should be aware of prior to booking. I knew that so I downloaded a couple of good movies from Netflix to my tablet and I had a good pair of comfortable headphones. I sat back and enjoyed the flight, had a couple of nice highballs and then a couple of hours nap before landing in Glasgow. All in all an enjoyable experience flights were right on time, if there was anything negative it was landing in Glasgow at 6.30 in the morning. My return flight was Glasgow to Heathrow then on to Vancouver in premium economy again top notch. I'm away again this September to Glasgow, my travel agent found me a very good fare with Air Canada in premium economy.";"Boeing 767 /  777";"Solo Leisure";"Premium Economy";"Kelowna to Glasgow via Toronto";2019-01-09 00:00:00;50;50;40;30;30;30;40;"yes"

I arrived at Beijing Capital Airport very early in the morning (much earlier than recommended by my Beijing hotel concierge) to find that the terminal check-in area was super crowded. Many customers looked very confused about self-check-in as ones were required to print boarding passes at check-in kiosks, and then to repeat the same process to print luggage tags at the bag drop area. I was able to print my boarding pass but the luggage tag machine could not read my passport, and no staff was found for help. After roughly one hour running around, I finally found a special check-in area tucked away on the other side of the terminal where I could check my luggage and rushed to make my flight. In-flight staff were nice, but there was no IFE. Despite all of the above, I still recommend the airlines as my flight departed and arrived on-time.

"Air China";8;"'''Service was smooth'''";"20th November 2019";"VERDADERO";"I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well. I was traveling with filming equipment and I've never had to spend that much time at security, unpacking my entire bag with all the equipment and letting it run several times through the x-ray.";"Boeing 747-8, Boeing 777-300,";"Business";"Business Class";"New York JFK to Shanghai via Beijing";2019-01-11 00:00:00;40;40;30;40;20;10;50;"yes"

The SIN-PEK flight I had selected was cancelled more than a month before the trip, with an earlier and later flight offered. All flights departed and arrived on time. The legroom and pitch were acceptable, and the adjustable head and calf-rests were much appreciated. The level of cleanliness was generally good, with cleaning of the lavatories by the cabin crew. A decent selection of English content available in the IFE system, though the touchscreen was insensitive and the audio jacks and headphones had to be cajoled into producing even tinny, monaural sound. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal was not loaded onto the SIN-PEK flight due to the schedule change, but the AVML and VLML meals on the other sectors were satisfactory. Each featured a small and rather underwhelming entrée along with a rotating ensemble of sides, including Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Upstate Farms yogurt on the EWR-PEK sector. A selection of soft drinks and Chinese wine and beer were offered during regular drink runs. The onboard service was polite and efficient. One issue was that the layovers were extremely long. However, Air China offers Economy passengers with long layovers free transit lounge access. Though the contracted BCAT lounge was basic, it proved very useful on the return leg.

Courteous and professional cabin crew served a lavish hot meal with several different savoury items in little plastic dishes - fish chicken salad plus a main of chicken curry plus dessert bread roll tea cider or beer. Landed on time and formalities to enter North Korea went very quickly. FNJ-PRK on their Tupolev Tu-204-100 wasn't as smooth boarding started early but a small hitch checking in a passenger with an oversize bag halted check in for over half an hour while staff dithered. This resulted in a departure an hour late which wasn't made up in the air and I missed my connection to the US necessitating a 24h stay in Beijing. Since I was originally only going to be in transit and not enter China Air Koryo's PEK staff had to rebook me before I could enter China which took about an hour. The change fee I incurred on my flight to the US was £300 of which Air Koryo contributed $100. Delays happen but this one was so easily avoided. Will definitely fly Air Koryo again as they are a very interesting airline compared to the competition (Air China) and have a vastly better onboard product but will be prepared for the odd burst of eccentric behaviour such as this.";;;"Economy Class";;;50;40;50;;0;;40;"yes"

FA's were efficient and any reasonable needs were complied with. However the IFE consisted of the same propaganda film shown in the airport and must have been on an endless loop. The flight left earlier than my agenda showed although we got there in ample time I was not notified of any change.

Although the seat configuration of the A320 is similar to their competitors they are still using very old seats that cause the feeling of having absolutely no room at all.

There is no real service except the sales-trolleys so I was extremly surprised to see 5 cabin crew members on both flights instead of the regular minimum of 4 (certainly not because of the work load). Their business class is a little joke - there's not even a cabin divider so I was happy that I did not pay for a last-minute upgrade. When available in the cabin the crew was friendly but most of the time all five of them were not visible on both sectors.

The passenger cabin is clean relatively modern and well lit. The seats have seat-back entertainment systems. I travel with an iPad pre-loaded with movies I want to watch so I can't speak to the entertainment menu itself. The food was relatively bland - simple but edible. They serve a ''breakfast'' close to landing but it's not up to much. Seat comfort - I was in 20H on the aisle adjacent to the bathrooms. Seat doesn't recline but there is no electrical box under the seat in front of you in row H. Flight departed FRA on time and arrived Windhoek 15 minutes early. The flight attendants were for the most part polite efficient and attentive without being fussy or cloying. This works fine for me but not for everyone. The flight is quite rigorously structured - drinks with a hot meal are served relatively soon after takeoff. The cabin lights are then turned off completely for the bulk of the flight (at least 6 hours). The cabin lights don't come back on until 2 hours before landing. All in all good value for the money and much more comfortable than I remember in the past.

After reading these reviews I was rather apprehensive about the trip, and indeed there was a delay for my first flight (I think because they needed a replacement aircraft), with the flight arriving Belgrade 40 minutes late.

Staff both at the airport and on the aircraft were perfectly polite. The flights were satisfactory and there was a bottle of water and crisps or biscuits handed out. You don’t get the explanations or the polish you’d get on British Airways for example, but it was perfectly adequate and very good value.

Air Seychelles paid the difference but we then had to fly into Singapore from Australia and lost the cost of our original flight to Chennai. We feel we should have been informed about this when we first booked and this would have saved us a lot of money. Apart from that we were pleased with the service of Air Seychelles. The service on board was excellent the food was pleasant and the comfort was of a superior class to many other airlines we have flown. Plenty of leg room and as the plane was only half full we were able to have two seats each. Personally we would recommend Air Seychelles to anyone but the flight to Singapore is only 6-7 hrs long so we have not experienced a really long flight.

Smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight. On both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept (no lie flat no electrical control). IFE is a joke (not on demand personal screens show only two channels) but crew can provide on request some DVD like personal readers with a (limited) choice. 5 movies that are on demand. Aircraft are old but food (choice of international and creole) and wines (1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines) were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts. Unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight. Beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley. Lounges good (but AF at CDG).

We flew on three of these - all were different experiences. The first leg AKL-PPT was on ''Moorea'' which had an upgraded interior and felt very new and fresh. Leg room seemed adequate for economy however as others have said previously the seat designer should be sacked! The head rest is not ergonomic at all and causes discomfort. The is also no lumbar support. I packed the seat back out with pillows to help. The crew were young friendly and worked the cabin non stop. Food on all flights was edible if not slightly odd - the seat designer must have had input in the menu as well. Entertainment on demand comprised of about 10 of movies (some recent releases) and TV shows. The second flight an 8.5 hr overnight flight from PPT-LAX was on ''Nuku Hiva''. This aircraft was also retrofitted with the new interior however it felt older. tired and there was a noticeable decrease in leg room despite us being in the same seat number on both flights. The crew were a bit surly and disappeared after trolley service. Again the seats weren't that comfortable due to the awful head rest and lack of leg room. Our third flight overnight from LAX to PPT was on ''Bora Bora'' which has yet to have it's interior retrofitted. The seats were much more comfortable than the newer version in economy as they lacked the offending head rest but the entertainment is on the old loop system rather than 'on demand'.

Communication wasn’t great but we spoke with another passenger who took this flight more regularly and this was apparently the norm. Aside from the fact that it was ''free seat'' meaning pick any available seat regardless of what was indicated on boarding pass, the flight went well. I would not recommend this flight if you have a tight connection, it would be wise to leave yourself sufficient room for delays. Most countries charge a departure tax when leaving by air.

As my check in baggage weight exceeded the 15kg free allowance as I had extra luggage packed, I was made to pay around 375 Rs for every extra kg and the staff there were generous enough to waive off 1 kg extra in exchange for a South Indian breakfast on the flight which was reasonable enough. The boarding started on time and there was some nice funky boarding music being played and the seats were comfortable enough although on longer duration trips, it could be uncomfortable. The flight departed on time and even though the flight was full, the crew were very nice and after takeoff I even got the South Indian breakfast which consisted of an idli, medu vada with sambhaar and upma. The meal was decent enough although if one has to purchase this directly in-flight, it was quite pricey at around 350 INR and maybe the quantity does not justify the price. But then again, low cost carriers aren't exactly known for being generous when it comes to inflight food and beverages. Landing was on time and retrieval of the baggage was also swift. I would say that the flight was quite nice and even though low cost carriers try to maximize revenue through ancillary services (meals / excess baggage) they provide the best functional experience when it comes to taking you from point A to point B.

"Austrian Airlines";8;"'''Plenty of leg room'''";"1st June 2022";"VERDADERO";"12 hour flights are going to be rough, that is a given. The airline industry even found ways to make long flights more uncomfortable as they have tried to respond effectively with Covid. Some background: I am 6’3? and a little claustrophobic. I look for every opportunity not to wear a mask. I don’t like it when the passenger in front of me puts their chair back as far as it will go into my face. But I know going in a 12 hour flight is not going to be a picnic. This flight was no picnic, but it was alright. Premium economy was an expensive choice, but it guaranteed more comfort. The seat in front of me was all the way back most the flight, but magical seat configuration made that less of an issue. Plenty of leg room. The food was good and they fed us at decent intervals. The flight attendants were nice. They provided noise canceling headphones, which was a nice touch, though I never used them because I could find nothing on their entertainment that I wanted to watch more than what I had on my iPad. The worst part of the trip was the Los Angeles traffic after we touched down.";"Boeing 777-200";"Couple Leisure";"Premium Economy";"Vienna to Los Angeles";2022-01-05 00:00:00;50;50;40;40;;;40;"yes"

I knew they didn’t have snacks so that didn’t bother me. But the flight was bumpy due to the weather and flight attendants were ok. The flight was on time, I made it in one piece and my bag was fine.

Despite having high prices AZAL offers good product especially on this route. AZAL does not allow you to purchase tickets online (with plastic cards) if it is not issued under passenger's name. They also stated ''AZAL holds right to check authenticity of plastic cards during check in and/or boarding''. In my case my parents wanted purchase this ticket but according to this they could not do it online. They personally went their office in Baku and purchased it. And AZAL added office fee. This is user unfriendly rule - Online check in was smooth. The flight was half empty so I could choose seat 12A. I had bicycle to transfer to Baku. According to AZAL's rules passengers can carry 1 piece sport equipment free of charge. In Ataturk airport staff seemed not to know this rule. I argued a bit then they take my mountain bike free of charge. It was handled gently which made me satisfied. The flight scheduled to depart at 12:20. This period used to be pretty busy at IST airport but we departed on time.  The flight was operated by 5 years old Boeing 767-300er. The aircraft was showing its age but perfectly maintained. Seat was comfortable and legroom was ok for 2.5 hours flight. Seat next to me was empty which gave me more comfort. Cleanliness of lavatory was fine too. Crew distributed hot towels and headsets before take off. Complimentary food and drinks served onboard. Drink service started shortly after take off. They offered different soft drinks, biscuits and crackers. Lunch service followed. They did not have menus. Lunch consisted of buckwheat and meat balls with tomato sauce, fresh vegetable salad, 3 pieces of cheese, a piece of cake. Soft and alcoholic beverages also served. During lunch they also served tea with lemon. Usually Azerbaijani people prefer to have their dessert with tea. So very nice touch by AZAL! Inflight entertainment well below my expectations and general standards. Seat pocket items were just safety card and Azerbaijan Airlines magazine. The magazine mostly contained articles about BAKU2015 first European games which is not so fun for those who do not have any interest to sports just like me. I had a seat-back screen but it did not entertain me that much. IFE contained pretty old movies and screen was sometimes not sensitive at all. So IFE was the worst part of flying experience.

I observed a certain irritation and anxiety with many passengers during my last trip when we had children running into the cabins from the other cabin and family members greeting chatting openly to friends or acquaintances in the business class cabin throughout the journey. Most business travellers pay a premium to get their rest or sleep and the constant movement within the cabin is most disturbing. The cabin crew needs to be given more authority to maintain it.

Even though the feedback for Bahamas Air was quite negative, I must say that it was much better than with other companies I`ve flown (WizzAir, Ryanair). The only negative thing was that the flight was delayed about 40 mins in each direction which is not something uncommon with flights generally. The staff were very friendly and for such a short fly they also served some snacks. I must outline that the crew even went the extra mile since they don`t offer hot beverages on-board but were kind enough to find some for us. There was plenty of seats since the flight was half full.

"Bangkok Airways";8;"'''okay on medium haul'''";"6th April 2019";"VERDADERO";"Bangkok to Male in august 2018. As a regular user and premier member for Bangkok Air, I was curious to see try their business class. I had accumulated an excessive amount of miles which I used for this flight. They charged about $200 in tax, which is reasonable, some airlines charge more or less tax for award tickets like these. The flight was 3/4 full on the way to the Maldives, and completely empty on the way back. At check in, it was a strange feeling when I walked up to the usual business class counter to check in for my first international flight with them. The premier lounge was quite empty when we were there first, and then gradually filled up to capacity. There is hot food table service, but recently this has been discontinued. There is only self serve but there are still made-to-order items available. Instead of doing a boarding announcement, a gate agent walked around the boarding area with a sign up saying “business class/Premier members? which is actually a much better idea than making an announcement. I was first onboard, and was asked what I would like to drink. I settled with orange juice. For a half past nine departure, lunch was served, and the quality and quantity was more than adequate. They understand that you will definitely eat in the lounge, and not feel that hungry once on board. I felt that the clear plastic bowl of salad (with “royal project? branding, they’re a subsidised group of high-quality farmers) was a bit odd, but then the salad definitely felt fresh. The hot meal was also good, and there were 3 choices. We were also served macadamia nuts in a bowl before meal service. I asked if there was any snack before landing, and they only had more nuts. Drinks were plenty and me and my dad didn’t realise we finished an entire bottle of champagne as they just kept refilling! The seat is more than comfortable, like a big lazy-boy. The crew seemed odd. The usual interactive ness and down-to-earth feeling wasn’t there, it felt as if asking for something in the galley (something I’d always do) was met with a weird look. The flight attendant asked me to press the call button, but I personally like going to the galley and asking for something, as it’s better for both. Entertainment is provided in the form of an iPad, and is adequate for the flight duration. Arrival in Maldives, I wish I could say that our bags were first off the belt, but no. It was quick, though. The return journey, felt literally like a private jet. We walked straight up to the counter, and we were given fast track immigration. Turns out, the regular line had no queue at all, so we just went to the regular line! Boarding was called for 40 minutes before departure, and we were still in the lounge when not 5 minutes later “final call for flight PG712 to Bangkok.? So we ran down to the gate. There was No line. Turns out, the load factor on this flight was 21 in total. Including economy passengers, that’s a 4:1 ratio of passengers to cabin crew. Leaving 30 minutes early, then arriving 45 minutes early. When we got to the gate (which was a domestic gate, the flight continues on to Samui) the crew shut the curtain between economy and made sure it stayed shut, and we were whisked off to a private minivan. The minivan took a shortcut to international arrivals, and we were literally out without any other passengers in sight, with our baggage in tow. That is the best Bangkok to Male in August 2018.arrival experience ever. Overall, I am used to flying Bangkok air on short routes, and they perform okay on medium haul.";"A319";"Family Leisure";"Business Class";"Bangkok to Male";2018-01-08 00:00:00;50;30;40;50;40;;40;"yes"

Check-in was slow, but were welcomed by a friendly agent who invited us to use their lounge. Bangkok Airways is definitely a boutique airline that offers complimentary drinks/snacks at certain airports for their economy passengers too. Lounge was ok with a limited snack offer (hot food and alcohol you would be charged for). Boarding was slightly late and went by stairs to ground.

Outbound flights and connections went well with great cabin service including champagne lager tea coffee and good quality rolls and snacks. Return flight was disappointing. An elderly aircraft really showing its age. In fact the seats in the row in front of us were a completely different style to the rest! The air conditioning didn't work which was unfortunate on such a hot day particularly as we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac at Paris for around 25 mins. Some of the no-smoking signs didn't illuminate - not a problem but reinforced the impression of a rather shabby plane. Very cheerful cabin crew. Arrived in Jersey for our connecting flight to Guernsey only to be told it had been cancelled - it was a bank holiday Monday and apparently they never operate that flight on bank holidays and we should never have been able to book it through their website! So what should have been a one hour connection at Jersey turned into 2.5 hours. Again not a huge problem but for an airline that pitches itself as something above the norm it was a bit disappointing.

The previous day I had tried to change to an earlier flight and was told that they were all full (festival time). Strangely there were at least six free seats on the plane so I don't know why they didn't rebook other passengers - clearly you have to ask. It's the same plane going back and forth so more susceptible to delays than others like Simrik that were using two Beechcraft planes that were half the size of Buddha Air's. (This also means that you can arrive at the airport see your plane but if it's an hour later you have to wait for it to go to Kathmandu and back before it's your turn.) Sweets for takeoff water in-flight which was nice - served in a 20 minute window. Most importantly it felt safe - the cabin attendants were attentive to this.

As I am a Silver member in their frequent flyer program, FlyMore, I checked in on the business class counter, which saved me time, as sometimes the economy class lines are long.

Bulgaria Air also offers extra legroom seats in row 3 (behind business class). They offer up to 2.5 times more legroom for 20€ more each way. The flight was pleasant. There was a snack served (a sandwich and a chocolate). We landed in Milan 20 minutes earlier. Overall the flight was very pleasant.

Strangely though while spirits were readily available wine and beer were on request which I found a little odd. Boarding was a free for all with passengers ignoring the boarding staff completely much to the annoyance of the gate staff. Upon boarding the plane was amazed to be on a wide bodied 767 which I didn't know flew this route. We were in 2J and 2K and having experienced a slightly cramped 737 flight on the outward leg were delighted with the idea of flat beds and tons of leg room. The flight departed on time and the jovial captain detailed our route. About 20 minutes into service drinks and nuts were served including a perfectly chilled Moët and Chandon before dinner service We had preselected our meals, and our thoughts that Carribean serve some of the best inflight meals we have ever tasted were confirmed with a superbly spicy Thai Green Chicken Curry for me, and a equally nice Thai Green Tofu Curry for my partner which were served after salads and bread. Salmon and a Beef Pepperpot were also available. Impressive meals that were this months signature dishes, Sadly my seat didn't work much so had little chance to enjoy the flat bed, however my partners worked fine. Inflight entertainment was equally limited to 5 channels which did work in some seats and didn't work in others which was disappointing. However the legroom and comfort was far superior obviously to the outward journey. Service was polite and understated which I liked, from a pleasant crew, and we landed on time in JFK.

After that boarding started getting chaotic, it was loud, people were shouting across the aisles, but the crew seemed handle everything properly, asking the passengers to sit down on their seats and not blocking the aisle. I needed the loo halfway through boarding and it took me about 2 minutes to get from the middle of the plane to the toilets at the end, the crew kindly informed that there isn't any running water from the taps yet and asked if some hand sanitiser and an antiseptic towel would be fine.

"China Eastern Airlines";8;"'''good food and service'''";"19th December 2019";"VERDADERO";"Hong Hong to Budapest via Shanghai. Flew on A320 on HKG to Shanghai while in a newer B787-9 on the long haul to Budapest. China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience, pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near X-mas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However, I was notified (2 months before travel) by my online travel agent (Travelgenio), that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then, I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus, I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent (no response) and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually, it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs (apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline). That even allowed me to do another, cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However, 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats, even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However, one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CE’s flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure: a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong, but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to check-in 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the check-in and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKG-PVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard, newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered (bring own headset). Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1 hour out of the 2½ hour long flight: during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kick-off and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines’ Dreamliner. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft, good food and service, 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean.

"China Eastern Airlines";8;"'''very pleasantly surprised'''";"26th October 2019";"VERDADERO";"Los Angeles to Male via Shanghai. I was a bit skeptical of flying China Eastern but I will have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The crews on all four flights where great. While their English wasn't top notch it was better than my Chinese so have to give them points for that. Service was decent if a bit more subtle than say CX or SG. Food was on par with US international long haul in business, but did notice the crew tended to not give the non-Chinese passengers the Chinese snack option. After the second flight I realized this and ordered the Wonton Soup as my snack on the remaining two. The seats where fine, again on par with standard long haul business even if the cabin was a bit warm. Couldn't figure out how to get the WiFi to work and yes we did register prior to boarding with their app. We did the 144-hour transit Visa and spent a couple days in Shanghai before heading to Male. Was laid out in easy to follow signage. On the return we did a longer layover and the Lounge in the new terminal was good. It did tend to get crowded in waves over the course of our 6 hours there. My only gripe was none of the showers where operational because “new and water no good yet?. But all in all, have to say it was certainly worth the money and would fly them again.";"Boeing 777 / A330";"Couple Leisure";"Business Class";"Los Angeles to Male via Shanghai";2019-01-10 00:00:00;40;40;40;30;30;10;40;"yes"

I have also set my expectation low so I wouldn't have regrets. We flew from Chicago O'hare check in line was long but it was moving fast. China Eastern airport crew was nice. Got in the gate we didn't need to wait in line since I have 2 kids with me so we were the first ones in the plane. We didn't had the seat number I saved through Cheapoair (don't know who changed it) so instead of window aisle we are in the middle aisle which isn't too bad since there's not much to see outside the window. I am only 5 ft tall so leg room was enough. Individual entertainment available. We're vegetarian so I requested for it since the day I purchased our tickets but for whatever reason the first meal they said we are not on the list of special request. We waited and later they came with a vegetarian meal. I am not very picky with food I tend to enjoy it even in the simplest way. Crew are nice too. The airline changed our itinerary from few hours to overnight at Shanghai before we head to Manila. It took one day off our vacation but it was good too because we get to see Shanghai. Both flights (to MNL & back to USA) are the same, overnight at Shanghai. Flight to MNL was good too, full meal on our 4hrs flight. So we had a good flight experience with China Eastern.";"Boeing 777 / A321";"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Chicago to Manila via Shanghai";2018-01-11 00:00:00;50;50;50;50;50;;50;"yes"
"China Eastern Airlines";8;"'''all pleasant throughout'''";"14th November 2018";"VERDADERO";"'  Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. My wife and I took a chance on our last trip to Asia and flew on China Eastern Airlines. The fare for the flights we chose on them were a few hundred dollars lower than what we were finding on more traditional Asian carriers. We booked our ticket through a third party platform (Justfly) in early October for a November 1 departure from Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. One thing that you will find out quick is that when you book your ticket through a third party, you are not able to then go back to the airlines website and check on the booking until the day before departure. You also cannot choose seats until, literally, you get to the airport and check in at the kiosk. This made us wonder if the booking ever happened. I even worked with Justfly to confirm and looked at my Credit Card bill in which China Eastern was indeed paid the money for the booking we made. So as far as I was concerned, on the day we left, there would be a booking. On that day, we went to the airport just a little earlier than normal to be sure that if there were any problems whatsoever, we could deal with them in time for the flight. What pleased me was that the booking was indeed in the system, our seats chosen and we could even change our seats right there. Another concern I had from reviews on this and other sites said that the bags would not be checked through to our final destination, meaning that when we got to Shanghai we would need to exit the airport, get our bags and re-check them into our Hong Kong flight. We were pleased that this was not the case and indeed, the bags were tagged for Hong Kong and, indeed, hours later upon arrival we saw our bags on the carousel there. Service on the flight was good. Coach class food that was served was perfectly fine. They did serve red wine on the flight and we enjoyed a variety of good food throughout the service to Shanghai, and then to Hong Kong. Keep in mind that the most safe food that one can eat is the food that is served on an airplane, so unless you are allergic to some ingredient that they use, you will find the food quite applicable and satisfactory. Later on when I was walking the cabin I noted a small bar in the galley that one could get a drink and a bag of peanuts. Aircraft was clean and seemed neatly taken care of, One thing that a passenger of a healthy girth may need to know is that the seat belts don't make it all the way. You will need to ask for a extender, which the crew happily gives upon request. The attendants spoke English as well as Chinese, and were all pleasant throughout the service we experienced. With more ''effervescent'' passengers, they still acted professional and held to standards at all times. The entertainment system at each seat had a decent variety of movies and the flight tracking program was as good as ones I have seen on American or Delta. Transfers at Shanghai for passengers going on another China Southern or Shanghai Airlines flight (the airlines are one in the same with Shanghai being the more ''basic transportation'' airline) are very straightforward, Just follow the signs to the transfer desk and go through security. Be sure to take out any electronic devices including power chargers for your phone - have them go through the X-ray without pulling out and most likely the security people will take the device from you with some excuse saying that it was too large or not applicable.'";"A330-300 / A321-200";"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai";2018-01-11 00:00:00;40;50;50;50;40;20;50;"yes"

I'm sure some would find the food a little underwhelming - word of advice-go for the Asian meal. There could have been more entertainment, not sure how many movies they had, but it wasn't extensive by any means. The seats weren't the most comfortable, but they weren't the worst either. My main goal was to sleep most of the way and that was achieved easily. I'm sure some folks would think this is poor for business class, but look at the price, that really is a steal, so my expectations weren't too high and they overdelivered.

I was able to switch to an earlier flight without paying for anything at the check in counter and the flight to Shanghai was smooth. Very decent amount of legroom space (coming from someone who takes budget airline quite often) however there's no in-flight entertainment which is fine since it's only a 2 hour flight.

The seat strangely enough isn't comfy when it's in recliner mode, much better in normal seating mode with leg rest/lumbar support adjustments. The message function is awesome. However, the seat design isn't really for storage of bags/shoes. The spaciousness of the seat is more for writing and putting many dishes/items etc. Nevertheless space is plenty in overhead locker. The CZ business class experience isn't designed for people who want luxurious/special flight experiences. It's more for passengers who want good products, great (Chinese) food and things that just work. The seat, plane and amenities are super clean. The punctuality is outstanding. The service is more on the practical and task-completing sides than those of Emirates/Singapore/Qatar airlines. Great attendance, efforts and politeness. Despite not being fluent in English the crew are very hard-working and proactive in helping people.

This meant they had to go through customs and immigration at JNB collect bags and recheck rather than just going through transit. Gave them a very poor experience of BA/Comair in Zimbabwe. This is an airport used by many international pax and should be able to do this as a matter of course. No lounge at VFA airport. It is being rebuilt so maybe will be better in future years.

Flight was initially delayed from 1200 to 1340 but then we boarded around 1325 and sat on the aircraft not getting airborne until 1600. This was due to ''bad weather'' in Shanghai although probably more likely the usual chinese air force airspace delays along this route which I am given to understand are almost constant. I accept this is no fault of the airline. However it might have been better to let us sit in the terminal rather than on the aircraft for so long. They gave us our meals on the ground, these were good. The flight was good, friendly staff dealing with loud and frustrated passengers well and spoke good english. The seat was comfortable. Check in and ground staff were friendly and the aircraft was clean. Return flight to Hong Kong was cancelled. This again due to ''bad weather''/chinese airspace. Problems with every airline so not Dragonair fault. However two queues to ticket desk (both massive) when we arrived, were for different things. No one told us which queue to stand in so we split up and stood one in each, eventually got a standby number, came back 2 hours later and was put on a new flight. This flight left very soon so were given priority security and baggage tags. Missed our connection in HKG but staff helped us get accommodation and a new flight in HKG. Staff at Shanghai were slow, didn't tell us which queue to be in or what was going on. However check in clerk was helpful. Again not Dragonair fault but could've been handled much better. 4 hours of queuing and then a sprint to security not fun. Flight itself was on A330, clean and had ife. Meals were good, so were crew, seats slightly dated but fine and aircraft clean. Would recommend Dragonair, they are a good airline and delays not their fault, just staff in Shanghai need more training at how to deal with this especially as it happens frequently. They are excellent though when it comes to reorganising in Hong Kong and as sister airline to Cathay Pacific make connections to them as seamless and worry free as possible. As you can make it all (international flight and domestic flight connecting) under one booking they will sort hotels and new flights if you miss connection so would recommend Dragonair especially if you are doing international flight followed by domestic flights within China.'";"A320 / A330-300";"Couple Leisure";"Economy Class";"HKG to PVG";2016-01-04 00:00:00;50;50;50;30;40;;40;"yes"

They manage to serve a full meal on the very short 1 hour flight which is excellent. On the downside our kids were not served their pre-ordered child meal just the regular adult meal. The deplaning in Hong Kong was via a bus ride. Must be a recent thing as a couple of years ago this flight did use a jetway although at a remote gate. Additionally the airline did not pass around immigration slips and we were turned around at the clearance queue to complete that step. This should be a standard process on any international flight. The return to KHH was messy. The flight was late and the equipment was changed to a Cathay jet. The famous CX/KA food was non-existent and instead we were served chicken wraps and a box of tea.

We were told that we'd see the Himalayas as we flew past, including Mt Everest, which we did. The crew were courteous and helpful, and the food surprisingly good for such a small airline. The plane was old, but appeared to be well looked after. There is no in-flight entertainment system, so bring a book/tablet to keep yourself entertained, or read the airline magazine, which will mainly feature articles about how much the Bhutanese love their King (they are crazy over their monarchy). If we are ever lucky enough to go back to Bhutan, I'd be very happy to fly Druk Air again.";;"Couple Leisure";"Economy Class";"KTM to QJC";2015-01-12 00:00:00;40;50;50;50;10;;40;"yes"

"Eastern Airways";8;"Eastern Airways customer review";"17th June 2010";"FALSO";"Newcastle to Bergen return: We were flying on the smaller of their two aircraft and there were a total of four passengers plus one flight attendant. All four passengers were seated in the very rear of the plane most likely to balance the weight due to the small aircraft. The good thing about flying with Eastern was that probably it was included in the cost of the tickets but passengers are allowed to go through the Fast Track security line. Also at Newcastle International terminal gate 31 is exclusive for Eastern. The terminal lounge was tiny and had bowls of sweets and copies of their inflight magazine. The downside is that the aircraft is very noisy so one has a problem hearing the inflight announcements and the aircraft seems to feel turbulence being so tiny. Also if you need to use the toilet try not to otherwise it's located in the rear of the plane behind a door that you need to be sure is securely locked or you risk giving a show. I could not for anything find a sink but there was a bottle of hand sanitizer that was available. The flight from Bergen there was no dedicated terminal lounge. The so-called complimentary refreshments on both flights were only drinks and either a packet of sweet or savoury snacks. The flight from Bergen the flight attendant offered hot towels just prior to landing. This wasn't offered on the flight from Newcastle. The flights were over an hour each and I think they could and should have served sandwiches considering they advertise how they are a cut above the other airlines. Perhaps it's due to mounting costs but other than those tiny packets of snacks they bombarded us with sweets before and during the flights. The sweets are not the best quality too. Return flight had a total of twelve passengers and one flight attendant. As stated in earlier reviews it seems as though Eastern doesn't have a huge customer base so I'm not sure how they manage to exist.";;;"Economy Class";;;;;;;;;40;"yes"

The flight attendants were cheerful and efficient. I enjoyed the inflight entertainment which had clear screens and a wide selection for viewing and/or listening.

The entertainment screens were bright and easy to operate, and there was a fine selection of movies, games, and TV shows. We were delayed an hour and a half out of Zurich, but there were regular updates. The negative aspect of this experience is customer service. They invite passengers to bid on upgrades to premium economy or business class, but the web site will only accept bids if your ticket was booked directly on the Edelweiss website.

This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32''). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership.

The luggage allowance of 30kg for discount economy flyers proved more generous than expected as my two pieces of baggage totalled up to about 32kgs, yet the gate agent still didn't raise any issues or charge me any additional luggage fees. As expected the 777s within Etihad's fleet are somewhat dated interior wise, where since the particular aircraft (first flight in 2012 after looking up its registration) took its maiden flight it is most likely the interior has not been renovated since. This doesn't prevent the crew from still delivering on a somewhat pleasant 14 hour flight tho, with 2 full meals and snacks in between. The only downside is the lack of a self-service snack bar in the galley of the aircraft, which made finding a quick bite, or even trying to grab some water after sleeping particularly difficult.

"EVA Air";8;"'''I did enjoy my flight'''";"26th September 2022";"VERDADERO";"With so much praise has been given to EVA Air's Royal Laurel Class, I was looking forward to my flight to Bangkok. The experience began at the check-in desk, which was swift and friendly. The boarding was also methodically carried out, with business class passengers invited first. The cabin has a 1x2x1 layout with a reverse herringbone configuration, and mine by the window. The decor was pleasant, with olive green, shades of grey and brown colours. The seat itself looked cosy and comfortable. Settling down, I took a moment to explore the settings. The armrest could be lifted or lowered. There was the usual adjustable reading lamp and areas for storing small items and drinks. The seat adjustments at first looked complicated, but I eventually got the hang of it. The TV monitor was set at an angle opposite and had to be clipped open to be viewed. Headphones were also in their own compartment. The fold-out table was especially large and sturdy. Good quality slippers, Jason Wu designer pyjamas and a decent amenity kit were also provided. PJs were really welcome and should be standard on long-haul journeys. Once boarding was complete, pre-departure drinks came. When I requested Champagne, I was told it is prosecco for now, but champagne with supper. Seemed rather odd! At cruising altitude, the 'supper' service began. The menu was displayed on the monitor, and there was a good selection of soft drinks, spirits, wines, and teas. I had pre-ordered my main course for both 'supper' and 'refreshment' meals. The seafood main course of tiger prawns, with cashews in a spicy bean sauce, vegetables, and rice was delicious. But the choice of wine was just red or white. For afters, it was cheese and biscuits, with walnuts and pieces of fruit. However, I was disappointed to see a branded package of mini Jacobs crackers - it just cheapened the presentation. In my experience, biscuits and crackers should be served loose. The service was rather rushed, with no drinks refills unless asked for. I also had to ask for a coffee before tucking into sleep. Once 'supper' was over, the cabin crew just retreated to the galley area until two hours before landing, when a 'refreshment meal' was served. My main course was an Asian affair - noodles with shrimp won ton, char siew pork and other dim sum items which was tasty, and this time asked for champagne and got it. EVA Air offers an excellent business class hard product. The cabin crew, although polite, were just not engaging. The was a lack of proper etiquette and finesse when serving food and drink or attending to passengers.

As I arrived at the domestic terminal of Harare Airport, I can clearly see the need for renovation of some essential equipment and facilities and it just so happens that the Government has embarked on mega-renovation and expansion projects at the Airport. Concentrating more on the flight itself, the pre-check-in speed and procedure carried out by the Fastjet crew is swift and takes no more than 20mins regardless of numbers as they seem to have a strict booking policy and tend not to overbook a plane, so the number of passengers can just about be projected consistently. What may frustrate the odd business traveler who may be in a rush to get to their destination is the mere fact the wait before the plane actually departs is rather long. Im not sure if this is due to the fact that the plane will be going through extensive preflight checks or that passengers have to wait for an aircraft to be flown in from the Fastjet base in South Africa. In closing the pilots command the plane and flight with extreme professionalism and on this particular flight of mine from Harare to Victoria Falls, they did make up for the lost time in the skies and one would hardly notice it as, the flight was smooth, no turbulence and the inflight crew members looked after passengers very well, even managed to squeeze in a snack meal in the short 45mins flight between Harare and Victoria falls.

The cabin crew were courteous, gracious and warm. I noticed that some of the flight attendants took particular time with children. The seats were quite comfortable, thanks in part to the significant amount of pitch and a wonderful foot rest. The food on the flight was tasty and served with courtesy. Each seat was supplied with a large and comfortable pillow as well as a blanket which made the ride  more comfortable and made taking a nap quite easy.

My neck was tilted and held at an S-curve angle the entire time, cart service would have been impossible, passengers had to shift sideways to use the front toilet.  Plus sized customers need to be given the option to purchase a second seat online while they complete their booking. If they choose not to, and they don't meet the size requirements at the gate they are sent back to purchase their 2nd seat. This gentleman chose to pay an additional $40 for the front seat and could have bought a second seat anywhere else on the aircraft, costing him nothing more for the second seat.

FlyNas is the low cost carrier of Saudi Arabia and recently added intercontinental services and enhanced cabins to its range of domestic and regional routes. I flew from London Gatwick to Jeddah with a connecting flight to Riyadh. The aircraft had been full on arrival at London but the passenger load was very light returning to Jeddah. As a result the level of service was terrific with a high ratio of crew to customers on board a very clean and smart A330-200. Business passengers can use Fast Track at Gatwick and have access to the Aspire Lounge. The seats are angled lie flat and very comfortable for a six hour sector with large pillows provided. The on board entertainment was supplemented by iPads with new release movies pre-loaded. Fares on FlyNas are lower than the full service flag carriers when booked well in advance and this was reflected in the meals which were average served in economy size foil trays with none of the fuss or flourishes of the five star Gulf airlines. This was fine for the price paid. Saudi carriers do not serve alcohol but there was a good range of soft drinks. An afternoon tea was also served not long before landing. The Saudi experience apart from the customary reading and blessing at the beginning of the flight did not really begin until King Abdulaziz Airport because the aircraft and entire crew is Portuguese hired from HiFly. They worked very effectively in both English and Arabic and were hard-working and friendly. The connecting FlyNas flight to Riyadh was a very typical low-cost service on board an A321 fairly tight for space full to the brim with purchases available from the trolley. Seating is allocated and there is the option to buy extra leg room or a larger seat at the front of the cabin but flights between the main cities in Saudi Arabia are not longer than a couple of hours so a standard seat was fine.";;;"Business Class";;;;;;;;;40;"yes"

I just can't find any mistake in their passenger handling.  Legroom was good, plane was only half full. The cabin service including drinks, was fine as they kept coming and offered new drinks. Food was average in my opinion, snack choice available but limited. Previously you had to change planes in Jakarta to fly to Bali, now they offer a connection via Medan. In Medan the plane got refueled, cleaned a bit and half of the passengers left here, while passengers to Denpasar had to stay on the plane. They promise a 30mins layover, but ours was more like 90 mins, which wasn't really a problem as it makes the whole flight still shorter than via Jakarta before.

You have to collect your bag in China, face a surly immigration official, pass your bag through an x-ray machine upon arrival, then drag it far away and upstairs and check-in a second time to get your connexion boarding pass and to reconsign your luggage. Also, if your connexion doesn't depart within three hours you have to cool your heels in the check-in lobby and sit with your luggage. That is a colossal inconvenience and when you're a man of my age (56) it is difficult. Also, Hainan AIrlines doesn't seem to have the right to use any of the gates at any of the Chinese terminals (or LAX for that matter) so plan on being bussed all over the airports.

I had two types of seat go to and back. I had the recliner type seat which was actually very comfortable and spacious. Coming back was their new flat bed, much like the smartium seats of Asiana or Emirates business class. Plenty of storage space and comfortable to take a nap on.

FA greeting at the door. Had my seat next to me open as promised so lots of space. Smooth take off and drink and snack service for the flight.

"Kenya Airways";8;"'''She was both kind and professional'''";"20th September 2021";"VERDADERO";"I had an issue with my Covid test (did it too early so it would have expired by the time I got to Ghana). The whole situation was such a mess, I was certain that I would not be able to fly. Lydia advised me that there was a quick testing station outside (which obviously required me to pay an arm and a leg because these Covid test fees are a scam. I digress). She waited for me until the last minute to get my results so she could get my bag checked-in. When I was running between the testing station and the check-in counter, she decided that I could leave my bag there (I was literally the only remaining customer, so she was just being kind) and took my number so I could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter. She did call me, and while I was running a few minutes late, she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and I could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through. Lydia was probably the most helpful airport person I'd ever met. While some of her colleagues were annoyed with my situation and essentially had given up on me, she endeavoured to help me well beyond her call of duty. This is the kind of South Africa I know - one filled with ubuntu, while acting within the confines of professional conduct. Lydia didn't break any rules or try to cut be some slack because that would have been unethical and against her professional conduct. She was both kind and professional.

The Plaza lounge at LHR was not serving alcohol on the basis that the food was not ‘substantial’. Boarding was chaotic – although there was a business line everyone was using it. After eventually getting on the aircraft, and after a long wait, I was offered a small glass of champagne. Seating was old-style parallel pair, business was about half full and there were signs of ageing. It then took an inordinate amount of time for the meal to be served – choice was “meat or chicken?. It was probably the first time ever that the starter and main course were both rice. The flight was uneventful and although not fully flat-bed I did manage to sleep. No bottle of water was provided. Breakfast was a small dry croissant, yogurt and a small bowl of fruit. I know airlines are struggling but given how much I paid for the ticket to have a service which was not as good as premium economy on some other airlines was frustrating. If Kenya Airways wants to compete with its rivals it needs to stop penny-pinching and offer its business customers a level of service which justifies what they have paid.";"Boeing 787";"Business";"Business Class";"London to Nairobi";2021-01-03 00:00:00;40;50;20;10;;;30;"yes"

Aircraft  were E190 on short leg and Boeing 787-8 on long legs. All flights on time. No luggage issues. Checked in online. Had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure. Upgraded 1st leg KGL-NBO by a modest, but successful online bid. Granted lounge access by courtesy in Nairobi as my Gold Card was just earned during the same trip (but of course not processed in their system). In Kigali they use Pearl lounge which is deteriorating since Rwandair opened a new lounge opposite. Kenya Airways Pride Lounge in Nairobi is wonderful. Food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace. However, drink supplies were fine. I like the “Happy Hours? approach they use on regional routes like to Dubai and JNB where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking. I have only received this double up service before on Gulf Air and the now deceased Jet Airways. That is generous, positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse. FAs are very good though advised an FA to avoid chewing gum as it is cause feeling of disrespect to some passengers. Champagne on business class is good and offered also before departure. No IFE on short legs but on long legs plenty of films to watch. No WiFi onboard.

"Kenya Airways";6;"'''very weak point is the food'''";"7th February 2020";"VERDADERO";"Bangkok to Johannesburg via Nairobi on 5th February 2020. Both flights on newer B787-8 aircrafts. Check-in and luggage handling went smoothly, but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my BPs issued on spot. Booking handling online works well. Their AF-KLM lounge offered in Bangkok is poor (like Thai Airways lounges) but their Pride lounge in Nairobi is good and spacious. Hardware on Kenya Airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues. The FAs are also good, plenty, observant. They are mainly Kenyans which does not help Chinese nor Thai passengers much. The very weak point of Kenya Airways is the food. Business class does not provide food any better than their Economy class and is plain, without vision, looking shabby. Competing airlines like Ethiopian, Turkish, South African, and Egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class. Steel cutlery and table preparation nice. But that’s it. Dinner from BKK was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs. Breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice. Very poor offerings. No meat, no cocktails, no cheeses, no ice cream, no smoothies, chocolates, no fruits (watermelon does not count). Extremely poor catering, a disgrace for the airline. Beverages are shamefully very sparse, only 2 juices (apple or orange) are offered. Wines are only passable. Beers are cheap, waterish industrial stuff: 2 brands, Tusker and Heineken – not providing any alternatives to each other. No souvenir, no pyjamas, no luxury feelings at all. No lobster, no seafood, no caviar, no mutton, goat, pork, no beef, no chicken (maybe inside the breakfast sausage). FA staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler. 1st flight on time, 2nd departed 1 hour late. Miles given quickly to Flying Blue. I will go again when the price is right. Lower expectation to food to zero and eat well at home or in lounge.

I'm probably unusual in that I actually enjoy an 11 hour flight with them-even if squashed into Economy. This was a full flight, 425 passengers, all expecting to be fed, watered and presumably pampered, down at the other end of the plane. The crew dealt with the vast numbers of people well. KLM staff are generally pretty friendly and this flight was no exception. One massive plus point I've noticed with KLM over the years is they match your formality level. I'm quite relaxed and the crew match that by calling me by my first name etc. Food was adequate for such a long flight. There was a main meal not long after take off followed by a mid-flight snack and a sandwich just before landing. The beverage trolley was wheeled out a few times. Usual tiny airline food portions however but was quite tasty-aside from a horrible coconut type dessert thing. KLM give bottled water instead of those weird plastic pots with the foil lid that guarantee you will drench the passenger sat on your lap in Economy. This is good. IFE with KLM is always slightly disappointing. Yes, there's a lot to choose from but the vast majority is American rubbish! Why the fixation with US content?? You're a Dutch airline. Show some European solidarity. I can't be the only one who doesn't want Americans screaming at me for an 11 hour flight-if I did, I'd fly Delta!";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"London to Johannesburg via Amsterdam";2023-01-06 00:00:00;30;50;50;50;30;;50;"yes"

We travelled with our 1 year old son, and with him in a carseat for the long-haul flight between KL and Seoul. The flight attendants wanted to see the airplane sticker on the seat but let us travel with it. We were in the cheap seats in the 3rd-to-last row in the back of the 747-8, in the middle. This airplane experiences a lot of yaw (side-to-side movement) during flight, so if you easily get airsick, I would not recommend sitting way in the back. There was not a ton of legroom but enough to not be uncomfortable. My butt got sore after a few hours in the seat, it is not well cushioned. You are provided with a pillow, blanket, and small amenity kit (cheap slippers and toothbrush). They provided us with 3 meals - a dinner, snack, and breakfast. The food was passable: they had chicken & rice, beef & rice, or beef & noodles on our flight. It came with a roll, dried pineapple and juice. They offer special meals for infants as well. There was no Wifi offered on this flight, and the inflight entertainment options were very few. There were some Korean movies and Western films but I only saw 2-3 movies I liked, which wasn't enough for a 12 hour flight. I've flown on the A350-900 on Delta on the way to KL, and there is a noticeable difference in the fatigue you feel afterwards. The 747-8 is large and spacious but doesn't pressurize as low as the A350, so you feel a lot more tired.

Lots to impress if all goes to plan, but be aware that they only have 2 aircraft (and one runs the Paris route) and no spare crew in the UK. Price are reasonable. Lounges not as luxurious as some but they beat sitting in departures area. Aircraft with big seats and loads of space, but seats don't quite go flat.  Attentive crew. Food excellent but not much choice and not overly generous with the booze. Tablets instead of seat-back tv's, they worked well on way out but had to be plugged into chargers on the way back. Movie/music choices limited. I would have been impressed with the package/price had not a crew member gone sick. After 8 hours sitting in the business class lounge we were eventually told at 9pm that the flight was cancelled. Irate passengers and disorganised ground crew battled it out. We were told that we could be put on the next days flight but they admitted they didn't know if there would be a seat for everyone. We were sent back to baggage claim and then check in and told that the reason we were waiting was so that they could book us hotel rooms, but they hadn't yet collected the form which asked if we needed one or if we would rather do something else. Many people had had enough and headed for Heathrow but it was too late to get there and fly out that night. We stayed and were eventually taken to a budget hotel in Stevenage (35 min drive in a taxi) which was better than it sounds and flew on the next day punctually. Fortunately for us we had no time constraints and the airline were happy to change our return flight to 24 hrs later. La Compagnie offered us a gift for the inconvenience of the delay, £440 off our next flight (but not to be used on the return leg apparently) and we have since discovered this is in lieu of the EU statuary compensation of E600 (which in fact converts at £480). Discussions continue. Despite all that went wrong I liked the convenience of flying from Luton and I liked the food and the flight but we had the time on our side. We ended up with the same deal but with an additional overnight in Stevenage so I would fly with them again. In summary, in my opinion its great if all goes to plan but there is no satisfactory back up if things go wrong.";"Boeing 757-200";"Couple Leisure";"Business Class";"LTN to EWR";2016-01-03 00:00:00;40;40;40;20;40;;40;"yes"
"La Compagnie";9;"'''deserve to succeed'''";"27th February 2016";"FALSO";"Luton to New York (Newark) with La Compagnie, taking advantage of their offer of return trip for 2 for £1700. Having read some previous adverse comments about this airline, we were somewhat apprehensive about what to expect. I have to say, however that our fears were unfounded. The whole experience - apart from the state of Luton Airport, which is not La Compagnie's fault - was very pleasant. The aircraft, which was immaculate, was not full on either leg, and the stewardesses, in their very smart uniforms, were friendly and most helpful. Indeed, service was excellent throughout, and food and wine were very good, albeit the coffee was tepid. Inflight entertainment is somewhat limited but was sufficient for a 7-hour flight. We found the reclining seats comfortable with plenty of position options. Check in at Luton and customs and security screening was very efficient using the fast track lane, and the newly refurbished Aspire Lounge is very comfortable. Overall, La Compagnie offers excellent value for money and gives passengers who might otherwise travel in cramped economy class greater comfort and a more personal level of service for a little more than the cost of an economy class ticket. It is early days for the company and, hopefully, the occupancy rate on their flights will pick up and thus make it a viable financial venture. They certainly deserve to succeed.";"Boeing 757-200";"Couple Leisure";"Business Class";"LTN to EWR";2016-01-02 00:00:00;40;50;50;40;40;;50;"yes"

LAN does not use the mood-light functions like Avianca for example. Not sure why. They just dim the light. 3x3x3 seating is not great if you are a single traveler or a couple. Then the old 767 is better. Flights were on time, cabin very clean, but restrooms dirty during the flight.  Seat pitch is ok, but there are no foot rests like Avianca. After I couple of hours I really missed them as my legs and feet began to hurt. Flight attendants friendly and smiling. Food is tasty but portions are small so eat something before you take off. Good complementary wine and several refills were offered. Attendants come through the aisles with water during the night. Very good entertainment system. Lots of movies and tons of songs on big personal screens. Minus is that there is no remote control so you always have to move up to the touch screen to zap around. Just bring your own headset. LAN gives you 2 contact headsets but IFE has only one plug-in so you'll get only mono sound using the LAN sets. Blankets and pillows provided. On the outbound even eye covers and ear plugs. Not on the way back though. No hot towels as I'm used to from European or Asian Carriers. Would be a nice perk.

"LAN Airlines";5;"LAN Airlines customer review";"4th March 2015";"FALSO";"I flew LAN on Feb 14 from JFK to MVD via SCL. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8pm. However it snowed (not heavily) that afternoon. Arrived at JFK with plenty of time. Flight shown on departure board as being on time. I was at the gate at 7pm and the flight still showed on time however there was an Air Berlin plane at our gate. According to the agent the flight was still leaving on time even though the plane was not there. We finally left the gate at about 10pm and had to wait to be de-iced. Took off at 11pm. Plane was a Dreamliner and other than the having little room between seats was great. Food service on LAN was much better than on American which I usually use to go to MVD. Flight attendants were young enthusiastic and had good rapport with the passengers. Dinner was a choice of beef or pasta and I chose the beef which was quite good. LAN still uses regular cutlery for meal service (no plastic ware) and glass for wine (no plastic cup). Breakfast was also a choice of two different meals cheese sandwich or eggs and sausage which I chose. The eggs and sausage came in s ceramic dish. Far cry from American's minuscule continental breakfast. Arriving at SCL all transit passengers went to transit area LAN had already printed boarding passes for connecting flights and also provided voucher for food while waiting for the connection. I don't think that any US carrier would do that nowadays. Flight from SCL to MVD was on A320 which was more comfortable than seating on Dreamliner. LAN offered snack service (sandwich and beverage) on 2.5 hour flight which most US carriers do not do any more. Return from MVD to SCL was also on A320 boarding pass issued at MVD showed Gate 5 however departure board showed Gate 4 (which was correct gate). Again LAN offered snack service to SCL. SCL to NYC was a nightmare. We were scheduled to leave at 11pm but did not depart until midnight. The plane was full with families with children onboard many of whom cried screamed at night. Perhaps airlines should keep a stock of pacifiers on board. After take off dinner was served and again the offerings were much better than American's. We were scheduled to land at 8am at JFK as we began our approach and landing gear and flaps were down the captain announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather conditions and we would go to Newark instead. Landed at Newark at 9.30am and waited for an hour on taxiway for gate to be made available. Disembarked at 10.30 and by 11 was through passport control. Then we had to wait for 90 minutes for the luggage to start coming onto the carousel. Left the airport at 1pm. LAN had no one there for assistance except some of the flight attendants who did no have that much information.

LAN provided a good on-time service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as I'm not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking. As they are part of Oneworld they will be getting more and more non-local speakers on board so they should focus on language skills even on regional and local routes.

Overall very pleasant flights particularly due to the friendly efficiency of the crews. Good food and drink and efficient service. On the transpacific routes the A340 has two business class cabins. The rear one (rows 6 and 7) is very cold and apparently the temperature cannot be adjusted so avoid these rows if you can. They are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers (including us) out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin (rows 1 to 5) where we were much more comfortable. However we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from Sydney to Auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm. We greatly enjoyed our flight in the LAN Dreamliner from Buenos Aires to Santiago. It's a much more comfortable plane than the A340. The lounge in Santiago is quite basic. It's narrow and in a basement but offers some chance to relax. The lounges in Buenos Aires and Auckland (Qantas lounge) are far superior.";;;"Business Class";;;40;50;40;;40;;40;"yes"

The transfer desk staff were overwhelmed when we arrived so we went to the business lounge. The attendant there confirmed that we had been rerouted to Istanbul then to Tbilisi. We asked if we could instead spend the night in Warsaw and fly direct to Tbilisi the next day. We were surprised to be accommodated especially as we were given a voucher for a great hotel and meal vouchers there. We would happily have paid our own way. We then asked if it was possible to retrieve our checked luggage and were directed to LOT’s office in the baggage area. Staff there also proved to be helpful and pleasant. While I expected to wait an hour for our luggage to be retrieved, we were out in 10 minutes with our bags. I should add that you might not want to believe everything you read about Warsaw Chopin either.

The planes do not have any seat-back entertainment units but for the outgoing flight, there was onboard wifi which allow you free access to a selection of movies and TV shows on the MAI app which can be pre-loaded onto phones, Ipads, etc. The selection was limited. For a 65-70 min flight, it is impressive that the cabin crew is able to come round with wet tissues followed by a meal and drinks service. The cabin crew were polite and cheerful.

This caused huge and unnecessary waiting times. Baggage took forever to arrive at LGW, not sure whether this is the airline's fault or the airport but other reviews have mentioned it.

Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay.

The only two minor gripes I may have is that the selection of movies and IFE is somewhat limited, and connecting flights as Muscat Airport involve a lengthy wait to get through security.";"Boeing 787-9";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Bangkok to Muscat";2022-01-12 00:00:00;40;40;30;50;30;;40;"yes"

Inbound flight from Osaka to Hong Kong MM067 scheduled at 9pm, delayed for 50 minutes. I took the same inbound flight in July 2017 and it was delayed for the same amount of time too, so I was prepared for possible delay this time. I had the Peach homepage opened with my mobile phone, so I could eat my bento in peace while waiting to board the plane and being able to check real-time updates of flight information. After touching ground in Hong Kong, I got the taxi calling numbers ready, so I could book one while waiting for my luggage. I also bought travel insurance before my trip, so I know that I would be compensated in case flights were delayed or cancelled. Given how I was prepared for all possible situations, I was happy flying with Peach as a LLC. Compared to my Peach flight in July 2017, I found that the announcements on board improved. E.g. Passengers were told about coming turbulence and advised to use the toilet before the turbulence. Pre-recorded announcements were made in both English and Cantonese. I was happy that Peach did not allow passengers to change seats, for security and safety reasons given many mainland Chinese tourists were on board. Both inbound and outbound flights were fully booked, seats were cramped as expected. Some passengers sneezed and coughed freely in the crowded cabin, so it might worth upgrading your seat to get some extra space and avoid getting the flu.

As such, don't go there too early before your flight (there are only two airlines and flights staggered throughout the day, so it is never clogged). There is no shopping or cafe. Just a gate, some seats and a bathroom. As there were no irregular operations, there was no real ground service.

The cheapest ticket doesn't include any checked luggage and only a small piece of hand luggage. There's a possibility to buy checked luggage in advance - but no such feature for hand luggage! According to this - a person travelling with, for example, a medium-size backpack, should drop it at check-in. Well - it's OK for a LCC to omit any luggage for the cheapest ticket, but why not to let additionally buying an option for large hand luggage? So, if you're travelling with anything bigger than a purse, it's strongly recommended to buy an item of checked luggage in advance - because at check-in desk this will be very costly.  Online check-in is tedious, with lots of advertising (do you want to buy an insurance policy? to assign a seat? etc..) One needs to visit the check-in desk for dropping big hand luggage off, for visa check - so a very long queue occurred. Surprisingly, but currently they don't coerce passengers to online check-in as it used to be some months ago - it's also free at check-in desk, but they also accept mobile boarding passes. Tegel terminal C, disorganized, with enormous queues anywhere - is a real nightmare, but that's not Pobeda's fault. They don't provide any meal service onboard, one cannot buy anything, even snacks - some passengers complained on it. Only drinking water is served. However, the aircraft is new and tidy, the seats are acceptable (Ryanair-like), though not reclining, the ground and cabin crew are polite and helpful. As for me, there were too much announcements, especially about smoking prohibition - this was repeated more than 5 times. Usually the flights are punctual, but this time we had a small delay (30 min), due to heavy traffic at VKO, I guess. Generally - for such a price the product is absolutely acceptable.

Airport Check In and security was all smooth through Brisbane. It was once I stepped on board that I noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane. Row 25 (back row near the toilets) and seats E and F which had no width and felt almost prison like. In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew. Would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue. Inflight services by Cabin Crew were excellent. Great breakfast options and Drinks. Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft? I think for the money paid for these tickets some IFE needs to be offered. Aircraft arrived slightly late which was confusing as we took off early - but the delay was not an issue.

As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear.

We had a pass given to us for the Air France lounge, Oh my trying to find this was a huge challenge, they really need better signage in this massively large busy airport. Fortunately the lounge wasn’t far from the gate, The flight to Bandar Seri Bagawan was unremarkable, nice food and comfortable, On arrival in BSB we walked to transfers to be met and told our plane was in the UK with a cracked windscreen and that our Melbourne flight was postponed. The staff were very good and had pre filled immigration forms for us, walked us through there and put us in a taxi to a hotel for the night with a voucher for a meal there. The same taxi driver met us in the morning and took us back to the airport. Went to the lounge for breakfast and eventually a plane arrived, we heard it came from Jeddah. The flight home however was disappointing, there were only nine of us in business yet staff were hard to find, they seemed to run to the back a lot, We were told brusquely - get your trays ready, meals will come soon. We got the first and second course then nothing. Pillows were distributed, no duvet. Entertainment was extremely limited, It felt like a different airline to our outgoing experience. I did ring the call bell for a tea later on. Nothing was ever offered during the flight. The lack of consistency was disappointing overall.

The food was  pleasant which is always a surprise on any airline in economy. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional.

The only hiccup was a lost bag on the way back but this was resolved efficiently by the airline despite a complex onward itinerary - and the Gatwick luggage desk said it was extremely rare to have lost bag on this airline suggesting it is not a systemic issue. A final point, although we were not connecting in Kigali, many passengers were.

Due to travel restrictions in China, there are procedures that must be followed in order to board the plane to travel to China with Sichuan Airlines. The ticket price is very expensive and ranges between five and nine thousand US dollars (for a one-way ticket from Cairo to Chengdu). It is difficult to buy tickets online, and you can buy them easily if you know someone in China who can buy them for you, or through the company's page on WeChat.  If you are traveling from a third country to Egypt to travel with them, you must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) three times within 48 and twenty-four hours before traveling in three different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in that country, and if the result of the virus tests is negative, the Chinese embassy will give you Green light to travel to Egypt. Upon arrival in Cairo they will contact you to give you travel instructions that must be followed to travel to China from Cairo, and then they will add you to the group of travelers on WeChat, you must have an account on WeChat. You must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) two times before traveling in two different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in Cairo (they will give you the address, and name of the laboratories, and the date and time of the tests on WhatsApp). The first PCR test is conducted forty-eight hours before travel and starts from seven in the morning until ten in the morning. If the result of the PCR test is positive, they will add you to another group on WeChat, and you cannot travel. If the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you, and you must do the test again on the day of travel. On the day of travel, the flight departs at around four o'clock in the afternoon. You must go to the laboratory to do a PCR test at exactly four o'clock in the morning. If the result of your examination is positive, they will cancel your travel and add you to another group on WeChat, if the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you and you must go to the airport to complete your travel procedures. 7-You should apply for the Electronic Health Codes. You can fill in the information, declare your health status and upload relevant documents online. You must obtain it before traveling, and it is preferable that you do so upon your arrival at the Sichuan Airlines counter at Cairo Airport and before completing your other travel procedures. You must wear a hazmat suit, the airline staff will prevent you from boarding the plane if you are not wearing it, and it can be purchased from any medical supplies store in the Kasr Al-Aini area in Cairo at a cheap price. You must wear a face mask during the whole flight. The company does not provide food and drink service during the flight. Upon boarding the plane, you will find a plastic bag tied in front of your seat containing some snacks and a small bottle of water. You must tell the flight crew if you want to use the bathroom, as they sterilize it after any passenger uses it.

Due to Chinese New Year and the Corona-virus it was pretty hard to contact anybody, so we decided to take the car to the airport. At the airport, the ticket desk was unable to change my ticket, Sichuan Airlines was unable to change my ticket, so we had to call ctrip. After nearly 2 hours we got the schedule change and I was able to get an earlier flight. Would have wished the airlines had offered me the schedule change by themselves. Service on the flight Changsha-Chengdu was non-existent. I am not sure if that was due to turbulence or to the virus, but it was just a two-hours flight and I had brought some food of my own. In Chengdu I had to get my luggage and wait for 5 hours to check it in again, fortunately there is a good lounge for transit passengers at Chengdu Airport. At 11 p.m. the Sichuan Airlines counters got really busy as there were many flights departing. It was really crowded, but service was quite quick. I was pretty surprised when the flight to Rome got cancelled, maybe due to personnel shortage because of the virus. My gut-feeling says the flights to Prague and to Rome were pretty empty, so they cancelled one flight. Passangers to Italy got rebooked to our flight and even that one was not full. Seats were a bit narrow and my earphones did not work, but I was so tired (take-off at 2 a.m.) that I did not need any in-flight entertainment. Luckily, there was no food-service at the start, so passangers were able to sleep. The flight-attendants handed out bottled water and snacks, when I awoke I found snacks and water on the vacant seat next to me. Very thoughtful. 2 hours before landing they served breakfast. It was not a lot, we did not even get trays. It was Chinese food and I liked it, but for Europeans who cannot eat spicy food, the choice was not good. I am used to spicy food, but even I considered the breakfast to be quite spicy. No drinks were offered for breakfast. Luckily, I always try to get a seat near the galley, so I could get hot water during the flight for my tea. All-in-all, Sichuan Airlines was quite cheap, the aircraft semi-clean and in-flight-entertainment choices were okay.

Legroom is adequate, if nothing to write home about, but certainly bit better than budget airlines, while the B737 is always a more width constrained than the A320. Pre flight service included face towels (disposable packets) and offers of newspapers.

In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product.

A 1 hour 40 minutes of delay for me was fine. Check in went smoothly. I got my favorite seat. The ground crew gave me snacks for the delay compensation. I boarded first. The flight went okay.

"Sun Country Airlines";2;"'''a very poor showing on Sun Country's part'''";"20th June 2023";"FALSO";"'  The worst plane maintenance available, on a brand new jet they alternately froze us then cooked us at least 4 times in a 3 and a half hour trip and gave the excuse that ''it is a brand new plane'' so we are still working out the details. Really? Do you think maybe they could figure it out before putting it into service? Do they think the same way about maybe the landing gear as well? Or the bolts that hold the seats down? Don't even ask what is going on with the temperature because the ''experienced'' flight attendants are not going to lower themselves to taking care of the problem, they just say they have notified the captain about the issue and they will glare at you if you ask more than once. On the next flight my air controls didn't work at all but I still had a cold blast of air coming down my neck for 3.5 hours and again no sign of help even after I asked what's going on with the air flow. I had to hide in the forward rest room and block the air vent in there to get respite. Very uncomfortable. This last trip (or non trip) was the straw that broke the camels back. I arrived as I usually do early by at least 1.5 hours and waited at gate 16 even though the marquee read 'FRONTIER AIRLINES TO ORLANDO FLIGHT 1194 TIME: 8:42 STATUS: NOW AT 9:02' which meant to me that my flight was probably delayed, so when I inquired I was told my flight had boarded and they gave my seat away even though no effort was made to call my name which is easy to do. I have a very distinctive name. By then 4, count 'em, 4 agents were busy making sure the plane was full and couldn't accommodate me. Even though I later found out they still had one seat available when my partner inquired with the home office. On top of that they tore up my boarding pass so I couldn't show it to bolster my complaint. I also turned in a lost purse during my wait time to gate 15 so that would prove even more I was there at the gate and ready as was another fella who was also denied boarding. I can't tell you how much arguing ensued when all this came down. If the agents had put in half as much effort into making this right as they did arguing and accusing me of being absent, I would be at my cardiologists office on Tuesday morning in Chaska, Minnesota as I was supposed to be. As it stands they re-booked me for 6-21-23 and my ticket has been messed up price wise now and I can't figure out how a round trip on your airline is $782.91 when it should be no more than $300 to $400 or so, no checked bags, just one carry on and one free one. I will call at 7 a.m. on Tuesday the 20th and attempt to get some satisfaction out of the front office. All in all a very poor showing on Sun Country's part and to boot a lot of accusations and arguing on the agents part, when they still had my seat available. The gal on the phone at your office says there were no notes about this transgression on the logs, but hopefully by tomorrow something will break. I really miss the red headed fella who was so personable and professional every time I flew out of San Diego, I hope he does well in Denver.

Pros: Brand new plane with top notch entertainment system including selection of 150 movies. The captain was very attentive to the passengers and communicating regularly, particularly during a long period of moderate turbulence which was scary. He also explained why they left with a small delay related to the late arrival of the previous flight from Tel Aviv. The online booking and check-in system was flawless and very intuitive. Cons: Boarding from a remote stand in Lisbon, but that's not the airline's fault. In-flight staff was efficient but not particularly friendly like in Asian airlines. Food was not great but still edible. The lunch was served immediately after take off and then a light meal was served just before landing. Considering the flight was almost 8 hours, there were more than 6 hours between meals and no drinks or food were served during that period. TAP long haul is not a slam dunk but still a very solid and reliable product to take you from Europe to North America. My favourite feature was the inflight entertainment system.

Though many counters at check in Bangkok were free they could have started to check in passengers even before three hours that is before 5.30 to avoid congestion and queue, the staff waiting passengers to suffer and make long queue. I reached there at 3.30 but, was advised to come at 5.30 pm and actually, counter started at 5.40.  3. In board catering could be improved with some time lag in all the services, viz. welcome drink, dinner and Tea/coffee. All things were served without any time lag.

There may be more room in cubicle but certainly not enough of them for the amount of people. The one I had to use had a lid that would not stay up and dropped onto my back and the toilet automatically flushed whilst I was attempting to use it. This was both unhygenic and very difficult to use. To get to the other toilet you had to pass through the stewards kitchen/rest area at the back of the plane which was curtained off. When I asked if the toilet was out of order I was told ''no''. There was an obvious problem with that toilet for at least two weeks because it was the same on the way out and return flight. It's a plane for long haul flights they should have more toilets and offer free water to drink. They also ran out of coffee, tea and drinking chocolate on the first drinks run.

When required they pushed through curtains without taking much care that they caught me as I was in row 1  and waking me up. Also on return the benefit of being allowed off before economy class was just ignored - they just let everyone rush off together, a bit annoying as that is what you pay for.

Note that there are only soft drinks available, but for me it doesn't really matter. The seats are not exactly Emirates-like, but still quite comfortable for an 8.5 hours flight. The headphones were usual cheap ''earbuds'' unfortunately, but they also included an adapter which I took away and which will let me plug in my own headphones on some later flight - great and I just don't understand why airlines (besides those smart few who provide multi-use washable-cup large headphones) couldn't distribute just that on request, rather than generating tons of ''cheap headphones waste''.

Liked how they use front and back stairs for boarding/de-planing as it is much faster than the long slow que on other airlines which only use one door.

IFE virtually none existent except for individual multimedia players for rent (600RUR per flight) with a selection of 15 quite new releases / music and games. On direct flight they turned on general cabin video system with OHP showing the flight info. Built-in audio entertainment system worked ok on both flights. If you want a pillow - be sure to come to a flight attendant and ask it secretly. Same with blankets - the number of blankets on board isn't sufficient and roughly only 40-50% of passengers got them.

"TUI Airways";5;"'''dull as dishwater B757'''";"4th September 2019";"FALSO";"Larnaca to Manchester. I recently enjoyed a holiday with my family group of 7 consisting of 4 adults and 3 children. The first point is with regard to the online check-in service on the outward flight. My wife and I have always checked in via the normal procedure at the check in desk. My daughter preferred the online method. To my mind, our use of the unfamiliar touch screen procedure seemed no quicker than letting an experienced check-in desk assistant carry out the task. One of my daughter's cases was found to be 2.5kg over the modest 15kg allowance. There is every chance that a person may waive this minor indiscretion, but the online system is totally abitrary culminating in a £45 surcharge, this was later waived by a TUI assistant to be fair. Moving onto the flight itself there were no issues of note other than being on a dull as dishwater Boeing 757. Very basic. The week long holiday at Tofinis Hotel near Ayia Napa was great, enjoyed the food etc. No probs. On the return flight we found it to be delayed just prior to the return transfer. 2 hours on a late night flight but no major issues, these things happen. However, it was common knowledge amongst the passengers due to internet checks but on arrival, the TUI rep chose not to mention it. I sort of understand that because why would anyone make themselves the focal point of peoples frustration if you dont have to. Onto the flight and again we found ourselves on the rather tired looking 757. I suspect TUI are suffering due to the grounding of the 737 max of which they were the biggest customers and I understand the company's predicament. The flight was adequate and on landing at Manchester we found the airport was disorganised due in part to procedural disruption arising from the ongoing terminal expansion. We were held on the plane and kept informed over the tannoy by a clearly irritated member of the cabin crew who informed us that we needed to be bused from the tarmac to terminal and the airport hadn't been expecting us! Half an hour later we were disembarking and the journey was complete. The following day I felt as rough as sandpaper, cold symptoms and a sore throat. I cannot conclusivly put this down to the plane journey but it is known that changes in air pressure can cause physiological effects like toothache and joint pain. Having taken trips on the uber modern TUI Dreamliners with their humidified cabin air I had forgotten just how rough an old plane could leave you feeling. I hope for TUI's sake that their fleet problems can be resolved sooner rather than later.";"Boeing 757";"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Larnaca to Manchester";2019-01-08 00:00:00;20;30;20;30;;;40;"yes"

Also they don't have life jackets - something that petrifies me as I panic when flying.

So seats are dependent on aircraft used. B767 is okay B757 is not. Guess 787 would be okay as well. Things are kept clean, IFE is utterly useless. Transfer in TAS easy if they do or tell you to wait for no good reason. Staff is average, which means like they seem to do their job alright but there was no pleasant surprises in service concept at all. Well considering they were cheap I would say I recommend to fly if all you are really after is a cheap seat with extra legroom. If you want a full business class experience I would avoid them.";"Boeing 767 / 757";"Business";"Business Class";"Beijing to Frankfurt via Tashkent";2017-01-08 00:00:00;30;40;30;30;10;;50;"yes"

The seat is comfortable with more leg space than is usual on budget carriers, my pre-ordered meal of chicken teriyaki was excellent and the FAs are efficient and cheerful.

He advised me to go to the gate, and talk there with somebody of the Staff of Vietnam Airlines. After waiting there for a while, a man arrived who took care of two older people in wheelchairs. I explained him the situation and asked him for help. Without further ado he took action and walked back with me to the security check. There he asked me to wait, went trough the security check, found my jacket within one minute and brought it back to me. Needles to say that made me very happy. I want to express my sincere gratitude to this man, of whom I don't know the name. He showed me what real service means, and did a good job for Vietnam Airlines.

Staff were no better, no worse in their attitude, i.e. very helpful, but they had more time to spend. There were also no queues for the loos at any time. However, one real problem was that the announcements were rather faint against the aircraft noise, particularly the English ones - more so than in Economy class. We can only understand slow, clear Spanish and struggled to stay informed at all. I never understood what the iPad was for, over and above the perfectly good screen, so I gave it back. The seat, screen etc worked perfectly and the extra storage room was so useful to have. The seat was very comfy as a normal seat, although my tray sloped badly to one side.

Our screen worked but some instructions would have been really useful. Everyone seemed to be spending more time trying to find out how things worked than actually using them, so it wasn't just us old fogies. Negatives all revolved around the seat and the food. The seats: We chose extra leg-room seats but there was actually less leg-room than normal as we faced a bulkhead - something that hadn't been clear from the picture. So, room for my tall husband's knees but absolutely no way to stretch out your legs for ten hours. The bulkhead really needs to have cutaway areas at the base. I'm sure that wouldn't be difficult to design in. The seat itself was very narrow. Even I, as a relatively slim woman, felt my hips were jammed in. The food: The pasta starter and the rice main course were both barely edible. Quite disgusting. However, the dessert and the snack were reasonable.

Ground service offered the Cuban visa before taking off. I found this a very good quota of service. The flight day I was surprised for them to be so punctual. We started the itinerary on time, arriving at Havana's airport earlier than expected. The seats were really comfortable considering that it is a low-cost airline, comfy legroom plus good in-flight service. They offer a menu with many options to eat in flight, and I consider they have really good prices, and they can get cheaper if you can pay in Colombian Peso due to the exchange tax. If you want to have more extra space in the seat you can pay $20 in-flight or COP 60.000.

However, on boarding we got chatting to a wonderful member of cabin crew who was able to move us into seats together in an emergency exit row. Throughout the flight he, and the rest of the crew were excellent and undertook their job with smile and humour. Our return flight 2 days later, was also excellent. We were delighted to see that the same crew member was once again onboard and he immediately recognised us. He went above and beyond to make our flight comfortable and again move us to seats together. Throughout the flight we were well looked after by all the crew who once again were so friendly, making time to chat with us between duties. The flight deck crew did an excellent job as well keeping us informed of turbulence (we had some nasty turbulence on the way out) and ensuring we were well briefed on the route.

It is important to note for travellers that you do have to pay for a carry on bag and pay for a checked bag, so my friend and I packed our checked luggage together and split the cost, however, make sure to pay attention to the weight. The website advertises that it needs to be 20kg and as long as we were under 21kg the attendant was fine with our bag. On the flight itself, there is a decent amount of space for a backpack under the seat in front and for the price you’re paying, it’s great. I was blown away by the customer service on the flight there. I am a very nauseous flyer typically, I get motion sickness on any moving vessel. I took a different type of gravol than normal and needless to say ended up vomiting 4 times on the 5.5 hour flight. After the 2nd time I vomited, they offered to move me up to premium class but I declined.

While the seats were not the most comfortable, and in the basic seat the legroom was fairly tight they did recline a little and there were power sockets/USD points at each seat.

We received a free accommodation voucher by Xiamen Air. The hotel we were given was the airline's own Xiamen Air Hotel in the heart of Xiamen. The room had two double beds and included a Chinese buffet breakfast too. Xiamen to Los Angeles on Boeing 787-9 was better. Great on-board entertainment, with plenty of Hollywood movies to choose from. We were served 3 meals and a snack on the 12-hour journey to LAX. I applied for their free wifi in advance (only 50 spots per flight), which worked well. You only get 3-hours but it was free. One thing that surprised me was the English proficiency of their crew. An added bonus was the opportunity to visit the lovely Chinese coastal city of Xiamen.

"Xiamen Airlines";8;"'''at a very cheap price'''";"3rd December 2018";"VERDADERO";"Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen. Note that my rating here is for XMN-YVR, not considering SIN-XMN, and not taking into account the visa issues at XMN. If you are not a holder of one of the 53 countries' passports that qualify for visa exemption by the Chinese government, then you need to apply for a visa before flying. XMN does not offer visa services at the airport. The main reason for the need of a visa is, XMN does not have a usual transit arrangement, which usually doesn't require you to go through immigration. At XMN, in order to transit, you have to go through immigration, which means you are entering China and then leaving China officially, just to transit between flights. This is why people transiting with passports that do not qualify for visa exemption have to apply for visa. If you are unsure, please make sure you email your local Xiamen Air representatives to check. Regarding SIN-XMN, it was below average. It was an older aircraft, without individual IFE system. The stewardesses were willing to help and respond to demands, but they were typically brisk and curt with their responses. Food was okay, not remarkable. XMN-YVR was excellent. The economy seat was comfortable, and leg room was good. Food was excellent and more than sufficient. In fact, the stewardesses made rounds between meals to ask if people wanted snacks, like bread rolls, sandwiches, or peanuts. The stewardesses were very friendly and approachable, very willing to help the passengers. It is unfortunate that their command of the English language is below average, but if you speak Mandarin, then you are fine. All in, it was an excellent flight at a very cheap price. I think, if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's Boeing 787, then there is a good chance that your flight will be a very good one. But if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's older aircraft, then you may not get to experience the better side of the airline. Finally, there is no online check-in services for international flights for Xiamen Air. You can choose your seats only if you spend some money. Otherwise, you have to request for your seat at the counter at the airport. So, if you want to choose your seats, either pay for it, or go to the airport and check in early (I went 2.5hr before flight) to get the seats that you want.";"Boeing 737-800 / 787-8";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen";2018-01-11 00:00:00;50;40;40;30;40;10;50;"yes"

Screaming deal of a ticket booked in 12/2016. Super nervous after receiving email in January 2017 of seat cancellation for the first leg of my trip (Seattle-Shenzhen). Customer service doesn't speak English. Got a call back in Chinese (my Chinese is ok, but not my first language) and took about 30 minutes plus another 30 minute call back to realize that the seat No I requested was cancelled and not the seat on the flight.  Over next few months, received a few more e-mails stating that flight times had changed, even though they were the same as when we booked them. Still felt insecure about whether or not our trip would really happen.  No online check-in for foreigners. We show up at the airport and have an easy check-in. Heard that Xiamen Air provides a hotel which the airport staff confirmed.  Arrived at Shenzhen to some chaos - they separate the transfers passengers, people are confused as to where to go, but are shepherded by the Xiamen air staff. Waited about 45 minutes with several other foreigners to get my boyfriend's 24-hour transit visa which allows him to leave the airport. Disembarked at Xiamen, shepherded again by the staff to pick up our baggage. Many of the foreign passengers did not know about the hotel that Xiamen air provided us with, since we all arrived around 9pm and had connecting flights in the morning. They expected to sleep on the floor of the airport. Followed signs to the reception desk that makes lodging arrangements. Showed our passports and tickets and provided with a room at the E-Charm Hotel in Xiamen. If you are travelling alone, they will pair you with someone of the same gender. The hotel is about 10 minutes away from the airport and costs about 15 RMB one way. Although the room provided was free, we had to cover our travel expense both ways to and from the hotel. I think this is strange. If you are only going to and from the hotel, the cash machines up on level 2 allow you to take out 100 RMB. Hotel was nice for Chinese standards! Continued to Tokyo in the morning. Flights were all around ok - seats were good enough, entertainment and meals were Chinese oriented - we ordered vegetarian meals.

After reading many reviews here about the transfer service in Xiamen I was a bit worried but it turned out ok. Yes, you still need to check yourself and your baggage in at Xiamen again but ground staff seem to be used to the procedure by now. In Amsterdam and in Taipei they understood they could only tag our bags to Xiamen. In Xiamen when arriving at customs it's best to have printed proof you're transferring but they have a list of transferring passengers. There's a counter for free hotel if your wait is longer than 6 hours. Don't confuse this counter with the ''transfer service'' counter that's right next to it, that's only for domestic transfers, I mistakingly waited in that line for some time. The hotel is 20 minutes by taxi but it's nice. One awkward thing is that they put 2 solo passengers into one room, luckily I didn't have any roommate. On the long flight both ways they ran out of coconut juice halfway. On Xiamen to Taipei they gave drinks only after the food, so you had to eat either thirsty or with cold food. On Taipei to Xiamen they didn't give any drinks at all but maybe that was because I had ordered a special meal when booking. China has some strict rules about mobile phones and power banks. On the site it says you can do online checkin if you fly from Amsterdam but I got an error when I tried, maybe that only works if you're not transferring. All in all, it's very cheap and the annoyances are not deal-breakers if you're prepared for them, so I recommend it for the budget-wary traveller.'";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"AMS to TPE via XMN";2016-01-07 00:00:00;40;30;20;40;40;;50;"yes"

Thank goodness, we were all underneath the required mass. The plane was boarded and we we got on the electricity went completely out but in a few minutes, we were on our way.

We did make it home safely and once again the pilot did an excellent job.

The meals are horrible I recommend eating in the airport prior to boarding. If you don't mind getting up and going to find the crew yes there is enough water I recommend you bring a big bottle. The first time we flew the toilets backed up the second time no problems. Movies were in French only on 1st flight that was fixed on the second flight. Overall you get what you pay for so I will fly them again.";;;"Economy Class";;;;;;;;;40;"yes"

I had window seat 30A and the legroom was just fine. Food was good but a little dry. Inflight entertainment not very exciting some Arabic drama without subtitles.

"ZIPAIR";8;"'''I’d highly recommend ZIPAIR'''";"14th June 2023";"FALSO";"A small bottle of water is $2. Cup of coffee $4. It is certainly easy enough to bring snacks/food from home, or pick something up from the airport, just be forewarned.  You will pay $50-$80 for any checked bags, up to three. They did not check the weight of my carry-on on the way to Japan, but did for the return flight. And as one of my checked bags was overweight, I had to re-distribute from on to another there at the check-in counter, but that was fine and the agent helped me so I didn’t have to pay for an additional suitcase. The seat was very comfortable, but you’re only able to partially recline it. There is no video screen, no in-flight entertainment, and the only Wi-Fi we were able to access went directly to their service site where you could order food and drinks. This is no frills but the airfare was $800 less than any other carrier. So even with a connecting flight on Southwest, and staying overnight in a hotel near the airport in San Jose (Hyatt Place, highly recommended) I still came out $500 under any other fare. The days when “getting there is half the fun? are long gone. But if you want a bargain flight price with nice attendants, excellent baggage handling, excellent crew, I’d highly recommend ZIPAIR.";"Boeing 787-8";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"San Jose to Tokyo";2023-01-05 00:00:00;50;50;20;50;10;10;50;"yes"
"ZIPAIR";9;"'''would definitely fly with again'''";"28th April 2023";"VERDADERO";"Very impressed. These seats are marketed as Business Class 'Lite' i.e.. you are getting a flat bed seat but not much else for the ticket price. However, I would actually rate the experience with Zip on this flight from Tokyo to Singapore more highly than my experiences with other airlines such as British Airways, who constantly disappoint. The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class. On the flight itself, the seats were very comfortable. The blanket provided was especially nice. As were the slippers. The restrooms were very clean and the toiletries provided were ample. Things like mouthwash, hand cream, etc. The staff were excellent. Polite, attentive, courteous. The food was good for what it was. I had spicy chicken with rice. It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class. Although this is a given on most premium seats, there are still airlines who cash in on charging for Wi-Fi (British Airways for example), so its nice that Zip provide it for free.

It wasn't possible to obtain an electronic boarding pass (iphone wallet version) from Adria's site. The option was there but it failed without any further explanation. Further more I was not able to checkin to return flight online - neither through Adria nor Lufthansa web site. In the end I made it via Lufthansa mobile app. Go figure. Both issues were reported to customer care and both were ignored. I experienced the same customer care ''policy'' couple of years ago when my inquiry with customer support was basically ignored. Flight was actually operated by a Romanian company Carpatair. The cabin was outdated and dirty with a funny smell lingering around. The latter stuck to my clothes for the day - not that great if you are meeting a client. Cabin crew was also quite disorganised and mixed up orders of all passengers sitting around me.

We did everything they told us to do to report it but they didn't honor it and it took 3 months for them to pay us around 20% of the replacements and extra expenses we had for days. Very rude, try to blame it on the customer, if you don't live in Slovenia and your only communication is over emails it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to reply even if you send them email right after they sent one. That day they lost baggage for 3 different passengers and when we had our return flight there were two more passengers that said they lost their bags so this is normal for that airline.

"Aegean Airlines";1;"'''We expected meaningful compensation'''";"19th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"I had a flight me and my husband from Stockholm to Cairo with connection flight in Athens. The connecting flight number was A3930, from Athens to Cairo. The planned departure time was 11:55 pm June 25th. The flight was delayed by nearly 6 hours from the planned departure time. We were informed the flight will be delayed for 1 hour before boarding. Before the new departure time, we boarded normally. After that, a lot of time has passed “ more that 1 hour? while we are inside the aircraft and we don’t take off and no information were given to us by the crew. From the aircraft windows we could see some workers taking bags in and out the aircraft. The crew told us they are having problems with luggage.  We are kept in the aircraft to nearly 4 hours before the captain told us that we can leave the aircraft and go to sit in the airport till the problem is solved.  Nothing was offered to us in the airport, no food, drinks or anything. In the meantime I tried to contact the Aegean Airlines hotline to help us, it was nearly 5:00 am already, but the contact person told me that she can not know any information about my flight situation because she has a limited access to information and she cannot help and I can call again after 7:00 am for another contact who has more access. At nearly 6:00 am the crew called us to board again but we didn’t take off till 6:35 anyways because the crew was replaced by a new one. We reached Cairo airport finally to find that our baggage didn’t reach Cairo airport anyway and we waited for 2 weeks till they reached Cairo airport. The delay collectively was from 11:55 pm to 6:35 am. We expected an apology on what happened and meaningful compensation as an acknowledgment of what they did. We complained to the company and their reply was that they were sorry for the delay and they offered the least compensation stated by passengers’ rights “250 euros?. They mentioned nothing about the problems that are caused by the poor handling of the problems they had.";;"Couple Leisure";"Economy Class";"Stockholm to Cairo via Athens";2023-01-06 00:00:00;30;10;30;10;;;10;"no"

The second problem was when I was about to board in Athens, when it was my turn they stopped me and asked for a Moroccan visa or residence permit, I said my passport didn't need a visa to Morocco for up to 3 months and I even gave him a look at the Moroccan visa policy and he really didn't care.";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Belgrade to Marrakech via Athens";2023-01-04 00:00:00;10;10;10;10;;;10;"no"

"Aegean Airlines";1;"'''only middle seats were available for free'''";"4th April 2022";"VERDADERO";"'  I booked a ComfortFlex ticket for a midday flight from Athens to Thessaloniki on April 3rd. We had a change in our plans and I had to change my ticket to an evening flight. This particular fare allows changes for the same day with no fee and seats were available on the new flight so I logged into my reservation and changed the flight successfully.  I then tried to reserve a window seat on the new flight but noticed that only middle seats were available for free. This seemed strange since the flight was not sold out and ComfortFlex tickets allow free seating in the entire aircraft except for the exit row seats, where a charge applies. I then noticed that the only window or aisle seats available on my new flight were those at the exit row and those would involve an extra 9 Euro charge. As I'm about to proceed with the payment of this 9 Euro charge, my boyfriend informs me he will be joining me on the same flight. We book a new ticket for him and when we reach the seat map on his reservation, we can see plenty window and aisle seats available for free. We decide to call the Aegean call center to inquire why our reservations show different seats maps even though we've both purchased ComfortFlex tickets and we're traveling on the same flight. Their response was that it must be a systemic error and if we wanted, we could wait until going to the airport and request a window or an aisle seat there. If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the ''system''. It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare.  We paid the 9 Euro fee this time but from our main choice, they will become our last choice until they get their act together. And of course it came as no surprise to read so many other reviews here from other passengers complaining about similar situations. I'm attaching a picture of the two seat maps and I leave you to draw your own conclusions.

Once we reached cruise altitude, flight attendants marched up and down the aisles demanding passengers close their window shades, and then the lights were dimmed to a lavender color. I walked up to the galley and confronted the purser to demand an explanation, and his response was that they did this to allow passengers to sleep.  Most people do not ant to sleep on a flight in the early afternoon. What's the point in paying $50 for a window that you don't get to look out of? By the time I landed back home in Chicago at 2:00 in the afternoon, I felt terribly drowsy when I should've been wide awake and readjusting to Central Daylight Time.

The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes for the terminal bus to arrive. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, ''they will give you seats on the next flight.'' The plane was served by only one bus, so everyone had to wait for all passengers on the plane to disembark before the bus ever left for the terminal. Transit passengers in Terminal D must pass through a security and passport control check before entering the terminal. By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their connecting flight to JFK had closed. Nevertheless, they made all haste to the departure gate, hoping they would be allowed to board, but they were too late. Aeroflot agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700. My wife had only a little over $900 on her card. I transfered the money to my wife's card so she could buy her and my son's ticket. This kind of mistreatment goes far beyond bad customer service.

The biggest positive is the seat is quite comfortable, and that's important. The negatives include an absolute horror show at Mexico City Airport T2 (and an even worse transit to T1). Nothing is particularly easy or smooth and Aeromexico does little to nothing to help ease transiting passengers through the madness. The lounges are third rate and overcrowded. As a result ended up finding a few cafes in the terminal which were far superior than the lounges. The really surprising negative were the Aeromexico business class cabin crews. While efficient in serving meals and performing basic tasks, not one crew had warm, friendly people that either welcomed you or smiled. They come across as some combination of angry and arrogant. It's surprising to me because it's not reflective of Mexico itself, which has some of the warmest, kindest people on earth.

This itinerary was impossible for my elderly husband - changing planes 4 times, taking an entire day of travel, and riding in coach (after paying for first class) was beyond his capabilities.

Then I requested a refund through the online form and I'm waiting to see how much time they will take and how much they will actually refund once their policy says they do not refund services fees, which they put up the double price of the actual flight. My guess is that they do that very often to oblige costumers to fly with them when they want, or when they have enough passengers.

It is a general airport transfer counter for all airlines, and all transfer passengers wait there for the counter to be opened at 6am. Based on the report from our colleagues in Beijing, on arrival you were met by our staff, who checked your baggage tag and passport. After the transfer counter opened, you were provided with boarding pass on time and continued with your flight to Hong Kong. I asked so many times Air Astana representatives to recheck exactly this details about operation hours of transit counter in Beijing, they weren't able to give me an answer. Based on the report - ''your colleague in Beijing met me and provided the boarding pass''?! Nobody met me at the transfer zone, the lady from the immigration desk saw i was crying and offered me the help, she wrote on a piece of paper details of my flight based on my ticket on my phone, the boarding pass i got only at the gate, couple minutes before it closed! My baggage was founded by Cathay Dragon - yes, but when at the same day i called Air Astana representatives before my baggage been found and asked to check regarding my missing baggage, i got an answer over email only after 1 week. I have been a loyal customer of Air Astana over 11 years and instead of apologies, Air Astana representative try to look this case that it's my fault - its fault of Air Astana representatives. You cannot sell on your official website the tickets which have only 1H transit time, i believe you should recheck transit desks operating hours before you sell those connection flight or at least notify your clients about potential risk of missing the connecting flight, as flight arrive at 5AM transit desk open at 6AM next flight at 7AM. 2.

Again, this wouldn't have been an issue under normal circumstances. I spoke to the baggage handler who told me to come talk to him prior to the next mornings flight, which was due to leave at 6am. I was forced to pay for a taxi which totalled 100 Euro each way (with promises of reimbursement) to the hotel which the company had placed passengers in only to stay there for 4 hours before having to leave again to catch the rescheduled flight. When I went to see the baggage handler I wasn't able to find anyone in the department. I went to the Air Berlin help desk and after explaining the situation to the woman at the desk she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if she was able to call the person who handled baggage as I needed to put my checked luggage on the new flight and she said she could but wasn't going to. When I asked again, saying ''Please, I need to catch my flight on time. I can't wait for someone to answer me knocking at the door, my flight leaves in less than an hour and I have to go through security'' She promptly said to me (in these exact words) ''Why don't you just do everyone a favour and go away.'' I flew to my destination sans baggage and deeply offended. Being under 19 years old at the time and a solo flyer I am to this day outraged by the lack of sympathy and understanding of the customer support team. I had to wait 4 whole weeks for my luggage to arrive at my final destination.

"Air Cairo";1;"'''deception, lies and lack of communication'''";"30th October 2022";"VERDADERO";"'  I will forever regret not treating the bad reviews seriously before traveling with Air Cairo. Their flight from Hurghada to Prague turned out to be by far the worst traveling experience of my life. First problems arose when we were notified in Hurghada that our flight was delayed by five hours. I discovered on flightradar24.com that the reason for the delay was the plane having been diverted to Skopje on a flight from Hurghada to Belgrade earlier that day. This was our first warning sign, foreshadowing what was to come next. When we finally took off and headed to Prague, the captain announced that our flight was diverted to Leipzig, Germany due to ''bad weather'' in Prague. The crew also told us that no planes were allowed to land in Prague for this reason whatsoever. When we confronted them with the fact that we were the only plane being diverted, they suddenly changed their story and claimed that our aircraft was not suitable for landing in low visibility. When we proved this to be a lie as well, they changed their story once more and told us that the pilots were inexperienced and therefore not trained for landing in foggy weather. What the real reason for the diversion was and how their side of the story would have developed had we pushed on them further, I have no idea. When we were finally allowed to leave the aircraft in Leipzig, we received no information about future plans whatsoever and the crew simply went to bed. The staff at Leipzig Airport were unable to help us either since the only people who knew at least something about our situation were asleep. At least that is what they said. Furthermore, they denied us access to our check-in luggage in spite of some passengers being in urgent need of their medication. On the plus side, Leipzig Airport provided us with beds and blankets to survive the night, for which we were thankful. Air Cairo, on the other hand, did nothing. The following morning was a disaster as well. A substitute flight from Leipzig to Prague was scheduled first for 5:30am, then for 11:00am. However, we still had no specific information as the airport staff was unable to reach the crew and the management of Air Cairo refused to communicate with us. The airport staff claimed that the only thing for which we were waiting was the crew, who were asleep at the hotel. Yet when the management of Air Cairo finally started answering our questions, they told us that the crew were already waiting at the hotel in their uniforms, not knowing themselves why they were not able to fly. What was the reason for the waiting, then? Were we waiting for the fog in Prague to disappear? We had no idea because no one bothered to tell us. After many hours of stressful waiting, during which we were again given misinformation multiple times and several passengers burst into tears, the crew finally arrived with no further explanation at 12:45pm and we took off at 1:30pm. To sum up, our landing in Prague was delayed by 20 hours. There are, however, two aspects of our situation that are most annoying. Firstly, it was argued that our issues were caused by fog. Yet we were the only plane on that day which had this problem and dozens of other aircraft were perfectly capable of taking off and landing in Prague. The problem was therefore clearly on the side of the airline and their pilots. And secondly, what I consider even more disgraceful was the arrogance with which the airline treated us and all their deception, lies and lack of communication.'";"A320-214";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Hurghada to Prague";2022-01-10 00:00:00;50;10;30;50;;;10;"no"

"Air Canada";1;"'''No remediation or assistance'''";"6th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"' Frankfurt to Toronto was over 1 hour late arriving. Scheduled for 1915hrs actual was 2030hrs. Air Canada (AC) knew this would cause EVERY USA bound connecting flights to be missed because the US Customs would be closed before we could get off the plane. Not to mention the sheer distance between our gate and customs would require landing at least 15 minutes minimum before closing to even try to reach customs before closing. No announcement that we would be stuck in Toronto. No offer of assistance to get us re-booked on a flight after Customs opened again at 0410hrs the next day. No help desk at the airport that apparently CAN help us. 2030hrs When arriving at the closed US Customs the security guy said, ''we're closed. come back at 0430 when we reopen'' When I told him that we had connecting flights to catch, he said ''Welcome to Canada please go downstairs and go through Canada immigration.'' I thought that meant we could go through that process and still make our flights, but turns out he was actually welcoming us to Canada as we were stuck there tonight and weren't going to make our connecting flight. We were actually told to talk to the person at the desk when you get off the elevator for additional information but that turned out to be a grumpy older man telling us he's not there to help anyone, just go through the line over there. Which was Canadian Customs and Immigration. Several flights were cancelled on the same night to the US. AC claimed would be handled automatically and notified via email about their new flights, but since my connecting flight still left as scheduled but without me or my family, it wasn't like that situation for us and we didn't get automatically rebooked for the next possible flights via email. Waited in the luggage location line for about 45 minutes about our luggage to be sure it wasn't going to the US without us. After learning the luggage was staying in Toronto, they said it would be safer to keep it in 'the system' and get the luggage assigned to your new flight and it will make it there. Otherwise it would take HOURS to locate and get them to us and we would have to check it back into the system anyways once we were rebooked. This was actually true in the end. We asked around for help and were directed by announcement to follow the ''connections'' signs to get help there. After waiting a while, that staff was clearly overwhelmed and actually started yelling at the customers about how they were NOT going to help anyone about rebooking or vouchers or anything. The line started getting very long when the staff started shouting over the public address, ''we are only two people here and we are not going to help anyone get rebooked, or hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers. You need to go upstairs where there are 15 people up there to help you. That turned out to be a lie. We followed the instructions, which ended up being the ticket counters on the departure floor, but eventually were yelled at again by a queen bee in charge stating that their only job is to help people check into their flights and since we didn't have any flights to board as our flight left without us, it was NOT their job to help us get rebooked. No remediation or assistance was given as to how we could resolve the situation either. I tried asking the special assistance table how I might get help and, after explaining our situation, she told us to go to the other area of ticketing counters for my spec'";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Frankfurt to Atlanta via Toronto";2023-01-07 00:00:00;30;40;30;10;30;10;10;"no"
"Air Canada";1;"'''support lines are totally overwhelmed'''";"5th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"I purchased a ticket to fly Washington-Nairobi return in business class via Toronto, Frankfurt and Zurich late June/early July 2023. All flights but the first were code shares on other reputable carriers, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. I've had excellent experiences with Air Canada in the past and really looked forward to this family trip. Just before departure, Air Canada cancelled its flight from Washington because of staff shortages. I called Air Canada and, secured a satisfactory booking via Montreal. That was almost immediately cancelled, leaving me trying to call Air Canada support till around 4am. After multiple calls and hours on hold, I was booked on a United flight to Toronto connecting with Lufthansa on to Nairobi. When I arrived at Washington Dulles, United reported that AC had only made a booking, but had not reissued my ticket as required AC staff at the airport said they were only ramp agents, they couldn't sort out the problem. I had to call Air Canada customer support. Eventually, they called AC support, waited 45 minutes on hold, and then had the needed ticket issued. I thought, foolishly, that my problems were over. Alas, AC had only reissued an outbound ticket from Toronto to Nairobi, without replacing the original round trip ticket. When I arrived in Nairobi, my return flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa system on the grounds that I was a no-show for the outbound flight, leaving me stranded in Nairobi. After an entire night and half a day trying to reach Air Canada support, AC staff finally agreed to restore my return ticket. Reaching AC took about an hour and a half on hold on each occasion, and AC dropped most of these calls after a few minutes. Only on arrival at Nairobi airport did I realize that AC had bungled my return ticket, having me depart Frankfurt for Zurich before I arrived in Zurich. Fortunately, the Lufthansa staff in Nairobi were able to sort this out on departure. I understand hat it's tough running an airline right now, resurgent demand, staff and plane shortages, forest fires etc. But the AC system demands that clients call their agents way more than should be necessary. And, at the moment, ACs customer support lines are totally overwhelmed. Having to spend whole nights trying to get through to Air Canada support to deal with repeated errors made by Air Canada staff is totally unacceptable.";;"Family Leisure";"Business Class";"Baltimore to Toronto";2023-01-07 00:00:00;30;30;;30;;;30;"no"

Our flights were delayed, particularly the Montreal to Boston which was delayed by around 2 hours (making the wait 6 hours) and the food was not exactly appetising either - which isn't even the important part. The main thing I really wanted to complain about was how badly they handled our luggage. After our 24 hours of travelling, after arriving in Boston, the last thing I wanted was for us to find out, how our luggage had been stuck in Montreal. And we weren't the only ones - half the passengers on this same flight were also in the same situation. We ended up having to leave the airport with nothing other than our carry-ons which did not hold much and simply had to wait for our luggage to be delivered, hopefully early morning the next day, as they told us. However, even that would not be the case. Our luggage was told to arrive that following morning, yet it did not. We had absolutely nothing and thus our initial personal schedule was pushed back and we could not do the plans we had made. They had delayed our luggage delivery saying that it would get to our door anytime before 7PM. And so we just waited. Until they told us that it would come at 8PM. We waited once again. Later we called them to find out that they could not even contact the delivery people who were supposed to be delivering it, which we found extremely unprofessional. And just as a further note, our suitcases were apparently at Boston since that morning, yet they failed to do the simple job of delivering it at the expected time they had informed us with. Not only that, they must have left our suitcases in the pouring rain as even when we did receive our hard case suitcases, half our clothes and items were very wet and soggy which added onto how annoying this situation already was.

I went online, took out my gift card, and it turns out they don't accept their own gift card. Whatever, I pay. They bring the food that is included. It's not good at all.  I wait for someone to come to ask if I want anything else. No one for about and hour and a half. So I press the service button on the elbow rest. No one came for another roughly 20 minutes. I get up and walk all to the back of plane and ask for Their meal combo. Turns out they don't have combos on international flight.  They don't have any additional food on this flight except for chips. I buy anyway, because there's another 5 hours left and I have a gift card... but they don't accept their own gift cards for food either. So it's basically useless now with the remaining balance....

There is no inflight entertainment, which, when you are travelling on planes for 10 hours is pretty poor in this day and age. They say you can download an app to your phone and get entertainment through this. We all did this but it didn't work and you couldn't watch anything without it constantly buffering! The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful, the flight back to Manchester was one of the coldest flights I have ever experienced - maybe the pilot left the window open overnight so extremely difficult to sleep when your teeth are chattering! The price wasn't that cheap as to justify these corners being cut. Also three out of four flights delayed and two overbooked and looking for volunteers to step off flight! If you have another option I wouldn't use Air Canada - never flown with them before and thought Air Canada would be good but left extremely disappointed! Final point, the app also doesn't work for you to confirm seats and do online check-in - it takes you to a ''report an error page'' which then doesn't work!

Once we figured out ourselves, we were offered (by text on the website) to change date.  So in fact only the date that was affected was changeable, meaning our holiday was shortened by several weeks! Almost never did a new search for a reservation work. It was not available or simply not possible. No reason was given. You receive error messages in code (no text, but numbers with no explanation whatsoever) for whatever you try to do. They offer no help at all. The chat on the website is a robot that is not even capable of understanding what your question is and responded with answers we never asked for. Asking for help by phone is impossible and not even free. I already had to rebook my flight 4 times and every time the same mess again. Eventually since July they offer a refund in cash (to your credit card). Although I was legit for a full refund by reading the needed conditions on their site, once I submitted for the refund, I got a message saying that in my 'specific' situation I need to call Air Carraïbes for further assistance and predictable as I had read in many other reviews. No one is responding my call. In no way is it possible to get decent help or assistance and figuring out if everything is still in the running is all up to you to follow up your booking. For 2 of the rebookings I was going to receive a small refund of €21. Even today no refund was given. But in the cases where I had to pay a supplement, before realizing it, it was already taken from my credit card. As soon as you receive your new tickets with new dates, you receive a message in your account that dates are canceled or will not be available (again). It's terrible how they treat their customers. Never flown with them and never intend to in the future. To be clear, we have a ticket and booked a flight, but we were so far not able to fly, change dates or receive a refund or a better date to fly in the future.

The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes, I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple puré/ baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed.

I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot. Even the African Airlines are better than Air France. The customer service on Air France is terrible and it is clear they have no intent of actually providing a decent customer experience.

I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ''Property Irregularity Report.'' Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags.

After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow.";;"Business";"Economy Class";"London to Dubai via Paris";2022-01-09 00:00:00;20;20;;10;;;10;"no"
"Air France";2;"'''it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me'''";"7th September 2022";"VERDADERO";"Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa.

I called lost and found and a very bored lady said, the cleaner have given nothing to me and I cannot do anything. Later at the airport, ground staff also told me how can you proof that you have forgotten the computer there! Cleaner from the aircraft said that he had found nothing and that maybe the crew took the computer because they do first check to collect forgotten items. At the day of arrival, Air Namibia ground staff was not willing to do any effort or investigation to get the item back. The day after customer care contact told me maybe passengers took it. Just to make things clear: In the business class, the overhead compartment is quite personal. Two seats have their own large overhead compartement. We were sitting completely in front of the aircraft. While leaving the aircraft, no passenger were passing after us and even the computer could not have been seen by other passengers. The overhead compartments are placed very high in the Air Namibia aircraft, computer was not in a bag. Our overhead compartment looked empty, thats why we forgot the computer. We will never fly again with Air Namibia.'";;"Business";"Business Class";"Frankfurt to Windhoek";2018-01-10 00:00:00;10;10;10;10;;;10;"no"

"Air New Zealand";1;"'''They do not care about their customers'''";"16th May 2022";"VERDADERO";"Due to the pandemic, I have been unable to fly with this airline as of yet. My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated. I hope to never have to deal with this airline ever again, and I am not looking forward to flying with them for my mandatory trip to get rid of my points that I cannot get back.";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"New York to Auckland via Los Angeles";2022-01-03 00:00:00;;20;;;;;10;"no"

Time at gate on arrival at IST was 19:00. Then we discovered that Air Serbia has been transporting hundreds of Lufthansa bags from Frankfurt which was the real reason of the delay. Passengers were unable to get their luggage cause the baggage carousel (meant for A320) has been blocked by Lufthansa bags coming from a wide-body from Munich (flight waited in Belgrade). It is horrible that Air Serbia gives priorities on New year's holidays to bags from Lufthansa than to their own passengers. Our bags arrived last.

"Air Serbia";1;"'''do not ever use this airline'''";"6th January 2020";"VERDADERO";"Bucharest to New York via Belgrade on 3rd January. My first flight landed in Timisoara (TMR), a small city in Romania instead of Belgrade, around 10:30am. They said it was too foggy but all other flights that day managed to land on BEG so the reason is dubious. Then, we ended up spending ~10hr in Belgrade, without any food, or information from AirSerbia representatives. I know they are obligated to give you food and water if the delay is longer than 2-3 hours. There were no representatives of any company to talk to in the TMR airport because we were at the gates and it is a very small airport. After realizing that I missed my connection from BEG to JFK, I called AirSerbia but they said that it is not their fault and they cannot do anything and once I get to Belgrade they will try to help. At ~4:30pm, after 6 hours of waiting, they decided that there will send a bus to take us from TMR to BEG (> 3hr of driving, while the OTP - BEG flight was ~1hr) and the plane will return to OTP and we have to make a decision of what to do. I would like to mention that the road death rate in Romania is of ~100 deaths / 1M people and that of flying is ~0 so it is absolutely unacceptable to ask us to take a bus to BEG, put our lives in such danger since we did not book a bus we booked a plane ticket. They did not want to send another aircraft although they had the resources to do so. They promised the bus will leave around ~5pm but then said it won't leave until 6-7pm. It ended up leaving after 8pm. Realizing we would be arriving extremely late to Belgrade and there won't be much support for us there (there were barely any flights to NYC in the next few days and all of them were extremely expensive and pretty much none with AirSerbia for the next week or so). I called AirSerbia to ask them to book my ticket since we were going to Belgrade and I wanted confirmation that once in Belgrade I have everything set and there is actually a point in going there. I would have preferred to do this before making my decision but they made us decide on the spot with no information of where and how we can get rerouted if we choose either option. AirSerbia told me that they cannot book on the phone and they cannot book a ticket if I go back to Bucharest with the flight which is insane given that the plane was the only way of transportation I had paid for. Anyway, around 7pm, I decided to not take the bus to Belgrade because I did not want to risk my life and get my own flight back and fight them via complaints and in court.

"Air Tahiti Nui";5;"Air Tahiti Nui customer review";"20th April 2015";"FALSO";"We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea. In conclusion if flying to Tahiti again I would try to find a different airline when booking but would likely fly this one again if I had too as the destination is paradise.";;;"Economy Class";;;0;40;10;;40;;30;"no"

Having flown to Europe with Air Transat June 23-July 6, 2022 for a Mediterranean cruise, they lost my husband’s luggage and we never got it back while in Europe. So when the agent came and asked us to give up our carry on, which they allow to have, I spoke up loud and clear that “sorry Madam but I’m not going to do that because your airline lost my luggage on June 23 and have not found it plus I have my meds in and what am I to do if I don’t get this luggage in Toronto? My husband tried to explain as well, but she walked away.

He also told us that I was confrontational and aggressive towards the agent and it will not be tolerated.  My husband decided to check our only 1 carry on. When he approached the kiosk, a new agent who was told to keep our Boarding Passes, started on my husband. Asked where I was to get me now.

Our bags never arrived in Paris. We filed a ''missing bags'' complaint after arrival with a great difficulty as English is not their forte. The flight was delayed just over 2 hours to Paris. Till the day we were in Paris, our luggage was never delivered, there was no communication from Air Transat to us about the luggage. In Paris, they did not even know where our luggage was! We followed up everyday (actually my nephew would call as he is fluent in French) lucky us as we had him, I can only imagine what other customers would be going through who cannot speak French as to if they would even get a response. We got a call from some driver who was to deliver our luggage 2 days after we arrived and said to us that ''we have your bags and we will deliver at 7 pm'' we did not know that they only had one bag. We cancelled our sightseeing plans and rushed home to find out with dismay that no bags were delivered and no call was made to inform us why. After this date, everyday we would follow up and got told that our bags would be delivered at 7 pm but never followed through. Finally the day before we were leaving Paris to Delhi via a different airline (22nd morning) we drove to airport to get our luggage. We thought we were to go to the terminal and talk to someone at Air Transat. To our surprise, we got a call from SOS Baggage and were told all our bags, not just one or two, are with them. Air Transat apparently hands over customers luggage's to some ''baggage delivery service'' which in turn hands it over to this SOS Baggage company that actually is a store which sells travel bags and accessories. The customer service at this place was pathetic - no apologies, no explanation as to why the delay, why these were not delivered for these many days nothing! On my insistence and a bit of raising the voice, I was finally given emails about paper trail and to my utter dismay they had the bags since 18th June, the very next day we arrived in Paris. It is pathetic that Air Transat deals with such a company that charges them for bags delivery but never does, is unprofessional, provides lousy customer service and does not give a rats ass for customer or their vacation plans going haywire.

We were surprised by the online booking fee that appears right befor paying. It was in the amount of half the actual fare per person. Once we arrived in the Philippines we received an email to inform us that our flight from Manila to Kalibo was going to be delayed.  Once we arrived to the check in counter to see if we can get on an earlier flight they were able to accommodate this. Our original flight was for 530pm. We were able to get on a 330 pm flight. We had to check in 1 baggage with a weight limit of 21kg that costed again half the cost of the flight?  Sitting around the airport we were informed that this flight will be delayed, not once, not twice, not three times. Our rescheduled flight was now 530pm.  On the way back, they decided a checked in baggage weight maximum of 10kg, so going there you are expected to drop half of what you brought? If we arrived 4 hours earlier (who does this for a domestic flight?) the fee would be cheaper. So another surprising fee. So now we are here and our flight is delayed for an hour and a half and this is the first flight of the day from Kalibo to Manila. I wonder if we are delayed 4 hours if I would get the difference back for the fee I paid to check in my 10kg luggage.

She was without shoes or a coat and we put off making purchases, knowing the luggage would be delivered quickly. As each day passed, we were given vague answers and handed off to other people. We ended up having to purchase clothing and toiletries for her, and Air Baltic refused to refund us for the bulk of the purchases, saying they would pay only 40 EUR. I was not upset that they lost our luggage. I am very upset, however that they would not resolve our problem until two days before we were to fly home, then they would not reimburse us for necessary items, and here is is mid March (this happened last July) and we still have not been paid the 40 EUR that they promised. They are treating us like we did something wrong, when we were just innocent customers. I will never  do business with them again, even though the flights were fine and fairly priced.

My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home.

About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway.

The email said that if I wanted to reschedule the trip I had to call certain numbers or go on the website for other options. The website included reimbursement as an option, but the Alitalia email informing me of the cancellation had a booking number which the website did not recognise. The electronic ticket number gave no joy either as, for some reason, Alitalia generated different ticket numbers for this journey - and so I just couldn't be sure that the request had to be recognised. The website is full of glitches and is generally frustrating to use. Having wasted quite a bit of time on the website, I had no option but to get on their ''helpline'' which, I knew from various previous experiences, is a misnomer. I called several times, was put on hold for very long periods and then cut off and, when I was lucky enough to be transferred to an operator, that person cut me off without offering any assistance. A few weeks on, I still have no idea if my ticket will be reimbursed and have now wasted hours on this matter. Unfortunately, this is not a covid-related development - this is the kind of service I have experienced with Alitalia for many years. Unfortunately, I often have no option but to fly with them. The in-flight experience with Alitalia is no worse than with a budget airline, but their customer service - through both the website and the call centre - is the worst I know. With all the covid uncertainty, these services are more important than ever as passengers are more likely than before to have to re-book or cancel flights.

It was a complete nightmare, and I am extremely disappointed in the way Allegiant handled my case. Overall, I would strongly caution against using Allegiant for travel.

After arriving, she waited over two hours for a ''paid'' check baggage, with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby, so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs.  A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew, that Allegiant was short staffed, and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App (even though you have her information, and knew she checked a bag - With no information, and with no-one at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back (we left messages) the communication was completely irresponsible and non-sympathetic to the passenger schedules (like college classes). I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back, paid for transportation there on the next day, Jan 4th, but no one from Allegiant was there (couldn't you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage?)  She found airport staff who said they couldn't help, but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon, but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact, no thanks to Allegiant, so she went in the morning. Why couldn't Allegiant take action to at least communicate? To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful, even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag? Why didn't someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers ''we had an accident, we are short staffed, Allegiant doesn't offer services (or care) so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it, taking a chance on when you arrive because we don't communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive.

We took the train back and arrived to the now correct gate 8 minutes before take-off and were not allowed to get on our 4:50pm flight, We went to American customer service and were told the next flight was after 10 pm and that it had no seats left. Agent gave us two standby passes and said we would not know if we can get on unless two people sis not show up or cancelled and we would not know until 10 pm until the after 10 pm. I asked 'what do we do if we do not get on this plane?' Well we were told we can apply to get a hotel room. Mind you I am 70 years old and dog tired from being at the Nashville Airport for leg one of our journey at 8am that morning, We could wait until after 10pm if we knew we had a seat but not just to be told we were denied. We had to see our daughter! I took an Uber to College Station and the Uber driver drove us over an extra 100 miles to charge us more, which was not the original route or price. I am dealing with that. I called American to see if we could get reimbursed and was told that the I should of gotten on the 10:00 pm flight as there Were 5 SEATS! The agent lied to us!

But I just found out that she did not change it at all as this flight counted in my BA program rather than my CX program I ask her to change. Secondly, the flight was delayed due to technical issue. Which was all fine because people understand that it is for the sake of their lives. However, the AA maintenance in Salt Lake City was so inefficient as it took them more than 40 minutes to arrive at the aircraft and commence the problem shooting. After delayed for about 2 hours, we started to board. However that is not the end, after all passengers took their seats, we have two passengers who did not show up but the aircraft was full.

Unfortunately there seemed to be another technical problem which held us for another 30 minutes.

The morning of the flight, I received another message informing me that again ''due to operational requirements'' the flight will operate at 12.00.

An entire day wasted by an incompetent airline. It does however get worse, it is now 2 days later and we are supposed to fly from Warri to Lagos, booked on the 09.20 flight. We have a connecting flight to Accra, Ghana at 17.10, so plenty of time to make this connection. Or so you think. I received a message from Arik 2 days ago informing me that ''due to operational'' requirements, the flight will now operate at 12.40. I'm still not too worried, as we will still make the connection. Don't hold your breath. I received another message from Arik this morning at 09.38 informing me that even this amended time has now changed to 16.40. So, to summarize - a flight supposed to have left at 09.20 has now been delayed and yet again delayed to 16.40.

I had a booking with Avelo (confirmation 8J967D) for a flight on May 22nd, 2023. My girlfriend and I were prepared to leave our home well in advance of the scheduled departure time when we received an email informing us of a 30-minute delay. Subsequently, we received several more emails indicating further delays, a total of eight times. Unfortunately, none of these emails provided any information or alerts regarding the closure time of the TSA checkpoint. We arrived ontime at the airport for our rescheduled flight at 11:45 pm. To my surprise, there was no one present at the Avelo front desk at all. An airport employee approached us and informed us that we had missed our flight because the TSA checkpoint was closed, despite there still being ample time remaining. He stated that the TSA had closed at 9:30 pm, even though there was another flight scheduled for departure. Besides, on the CHO airport, it is clearly stated that ''The daily closing time is dependent on the airline schedule and delays''. More passengers arrived subsequently, with some needing to check in their luggage. However, there was still no one available at the front desk to assist them. After waiting in line for 25 minutes, I managed to reach an Avelo customer service agent over the phone. The lady I spoke with was courteous and assured me that I would be compensated not only for my flight but also for the hotel and any other costs incurred as a result of this incident. Unfortunately, she informed me that there was no alternative way for us to be accommodated on another flight. I made an attempt to contact them, but unfortunately, they changed their words. They simply resorted to using a generic template without addressing any of my specific concerns.

I cannot emphasize this enough: we will not fly on Avelo ever again. First, our flight (XP 719) was delayed due to being overweight. As a result, 30 passengers were asked to volunteer to take a later flight (yes, overbooked by 30 passengers). We were delayed because Avelo wanted to wait until people took their buyout option, which was raised continuously over the course of an hour until 30 people had accepted. The delay was not weather or technical issue, it was a known mistake by Avelo that we, the passengers, had to simply absorb. Unbeknownst to any of us, Avelo had also decided not to put over half of the checked bags onto the flight. Avelo knew this before we took off and said nothing. We landed and waited for nearly 2 hours at the baggage claim, a group of approximately 40 passengers waiting for our bags. Finally, an agent came to tell us that the bags had never been loaded (again, they made this decision hours ago before departure but did not inform us). Our options were to get in a makeshift line and give our bag claim info (again) to this agent who slowly repeated the claim numbers into her cellphone. We could have Fedex deliver the bags, no promise when they would arrive OR come back to the airport in the middle of the night to retrieve them, but they weren’t sure which flight it would be or the exact arrival time. I was told Avelo would call during the night to confirm my bag had arrived (this did not happen). The next morning I called both Avelo numbers and sat on hold for 90 minutes and 60 minutes respectively, no one picked up. I called Orlando airport’s customer service and was helpfully transferred to an Avelo agent there. That person said my bag was not there and she could not say where the bag was or what the process would be for finding it (“Just call the customer service number!? she said). I began frantically calling the departure airport, was given an Avelo work phone to call, left a voicemail. Then, I received an email explaining that due to weight restrictions, many bags had not been loaded onto the flight, come pick up your bag and get a $50 credit for an Avelo flight. On this email, I saw my name had been wildly misspelled. So, I called Orlando and was transferred yet again to the Avelo agent. She laughed and said, “Oh right! I realized your bag is here after you called, you can come get it.? She could not explain why she didn’t just call me when she found my bag. I had given her my phone number. She could not tell me how to file a claim to be reimbursed for the additional cab fares to and from the airport to get my bag (this doesn't even touch the toiletries and rental car I had to cancel because I was stuck waiting for my bag at the airport the previous day, despite Avelo knowing that my bag was not there). She referred me again to the customer service number that no one answers. As it stands, my wife will need to cancel some of her plans today so that she can be with our son while I cab back to the airport again to find my bag. The total lack of communication and thoughtlessness on the part of Avelo is not something I can forgive. I am generally tolerant of mistakes and unforeseen problems that arise with air travel, its just part of the reality of flying, but to have my time and stress so completely disregarded by this company means that I will not give them my money again.";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"New Haven to Orlando";2023-01-03 00:00:00;10;30;;10;;;10;"no"

They offered minor compensation for a huge disruption and only 22 people took the offer. Unfortunately 7 people were denied boarding and told you aren't getting home tonight. As we finally board the plane an hour and a half later I was sat next to a window whose internal frame was no longer attached to the airplane with anything other than my broad shoulders and arm holding it.

The sole purpose of booking the second trip was to utilize the credits provided as compensation for the previous disastrous experience. Avianca canceled our reservation without any prior notification or approval after we submitted a refund request to modify the final leg of our flight. They refunded a mere $387, disregarding the $1,132 we had originally paid and cancelled the entire flight without approval. Furthermore, the refund request email actually said “rejected? so we showed up to the airport thinking nothing changed from our original plans. The lack of communication regarding this refund and the cancellation of our trip is completely unacceptable. Avianca's incompetence and failure to communicate are deeply concerning. The airline's subpar customer support and inefficient processes are costing both customers and the company unnecessary time and money. This issue should have been resolved within a reasonable timeframe, not after spending over five hours discussing it without resolution.

Interestingly, people who were traveling with much larger items were allowed to proceed without purchasing additional luggage (i.e. guitars). During the ticketing process, Avianca employees were forcing passengers with suspected personal items ''too large'' to get out of the ticketing line to measure their items, in an attempt to extort more money (similar to other cheap airlines).

Seat pitch is the tightest I've seen on any airline and feels extremely uncomfortable, even though it was just a 2 hrs flight. They used these configuration even for flights to the Caribbean - hard to imagine this on 10 hrs flight. Passengers are mostly party tourists visiting Mallorca for drinking. Which makes sense for Azur Air's very low budget target group for their flights. Service aboard was rather poor. Drinks and meals on purchase only. They didn't provide a menu because the plane is also operating in Ukraine. Therefore all magazines were in Cyrillic and they didn't have German ones aboard. That's why it was even unclear which meals and beverages they offer. No inflight entertainment and no Wifi. Cabin crew seemed pretty new in the job and unexperienced. There were no clear procedures on board and even while boarding, creating an overall unprofessional impression of Azur Air. You could tell how Azur Air staff ''disliked'' the clientele on board.

Instead they decided to keep the luggage in Melbourne to save them the transportation costs. In spite of several emails, I did not receive any communication until the last day of my return. For all the inconvenience and additional expenses incurred on the essentials, we were offered a paltry compensation of $60. It was more an insult than a compensation and hence, I did not accept the compensation. Apparently, that is their policy. As per Montreal convention, which Vietnam is part of, airlines are required to compensate customers for baggage delays with up to $1700 USD. They are misleading people stating that their company policy allows them to compensate up to a maximum of $30 only. They turned our holiday into a nightmare as we had to shop for essentials including basic clothes for three of us, which included a 3 year old toddler. We spent over $1700 in essentials and $60 does not even remotely make up for it. Imagine spending time shopping in an alien country with a toddler when we should have been enjoying our holiday.

Okay, silly, but I was over it, I just wanted some sort of a refund. She said the refund would be processed in 15-30 working days. She then told me I needed to provide the full credit card number I used for the original booking, even though she had it. I had an issue with this request for obvious security reasons, but complied and gave her the number. After providing my credit card number, I figured all was good and settled - wrong. I was then told I'd receive an email I needed to send them a copy of my Passport. Why I asked? She said it was company policy. One more questionable security violation, in my mind.

There were screens but we were not offered headsets! On our return flight, my friends suitcase had the zip ripped out when it was going through the X-ray machine in Bali and after much confusion and no solution from the staff at Batik Air in Bali, we had to carry it onto the aircraft and put it in the luggage compartment inside the plane. They confiscated all her toiletries because you are not allowed oversized creams etc inside the plane. This mishap caused the plane to leave about 30 minutes late. The steward made no attempt to show us where to sit so we just sat where there were empty seats. Once again, there were only two stewards (although on this flight the plane was not full). There was no safety demonstration from the staff and no checking of seat belts, upright seats or ensuring bags were secure. It was freezing and when I asked for a blanket, I was told they were only available to Business Class passengers, however after I insisted, she relented and gave me one. The food was once again, disgusting, and again, they had run out of milk. I asked for coke and when I took a sip, it was hot!!

However, all flights to Hailar was fully booked due to peak season. And we were informed by the airline that the earliest available flight was on 05 August which affected our original plan greatly. To minimize the delay to Hulunbuir, we have no choice but to source for alternative flight from another airline, having the earliest available flight on 04 August. According to our conversation with Beijing Capital Airlines's operator, the airline was able to refund our tickets. After made a request of the Flight Delayed Certificate and ultimately we received it after we come back from our trip. Reason stated in their certificate is cancelled due to aircraft adjustment.

With no choice really: lose the flight or pay up. Called the airline the same day and pointed out all the issues. According to Blue Panorama the new policy is a tremendous improvement, allowing the valued customer to take the flight with a little bit of extortion. I learned that the booking form still has no field for the second name but the customer is expected to input any additional names in the name field after the first one, without spaces. This is priceless. Not surprisingly, I also learnt that the only way to request a reimbursement is to send an insured letter.

Yesterday I had the pleasure of sitting through the ordeal again, and the plane was delayed for 2 hours, due to the pilot being ''stuck in traffic'' coming from London, which was further explained to be a consequence of bad weather the previous day. Nice try but how is that even relevant. Upside of running 2 hours late, one would expect that staff would have had plenty of time to prepare the cabin and solve all possible issues, but alas, unfortunately there was no catering onboard this service tonight, as a sign of their aptitude for crisis management, the airline had managed to scramble leftover sandwiches from other airlines and two bottles of water. Saving the best for last, the cabin attendant unfortunately also had to announce that something was not quite right with the heating system, causing the cabin temperature to be just over freezing point with vents blowing icy air into the cabin. For our comfort the captain generously decided to fly on to Brussels rather than return to Bristol. Of course he did, or they would have had to pay compensation to the passengers.

I don’t need the credit cause I will never fly with them again. Oh and this is the second time this has happened to me, the first time I took the credit cause the poor lady at the gate was so nice.

Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines. ";"A320 Finnair";"Business";"Business Class";"London Heathrow to Malaga";2023-01-05 00:00:00;20;20;30;10;10;10;10;"no"

"British Airways";5;"'''premium price for very average service'''";"28th April 2023";"FALSO";"Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service.

So I really wasn't expecting much. Just a whatever meal until I get to my destination. Well to my disappointment, on all of my transits flights I was only served one vegan meal, that is unacceptable. On the Atlanta flight to Frankfurt, I was served rice with a few vegetables for dinner, which was fine, no complaints there. Then comes breakfast time, everybody was given their whatever meal and I was told that they only have an apple for me, ''the flight attendance exact words to me were, ''well you a vegan right, I can only give you the apple.'' I respectfully said no thank you to her. Everybody else was given their whatever meal which was a sandwich, yogurt and an apple. My flight from Brussels to Banjul, again I was served some nasty looking what looked like beans with some red sauce over couscous and that was all I got. For breakfast, they gave me and everyone else a big waffle which I didn't eat because I suspected there might be eggs in it. These airlines should do better in the ways they treat people.  I went online and booked my ticket to fit my travel needs and at a price that was affordable to me. So when I tell you am a vegan, you should make the proper accommodations for me, this was a very long journey with very short transit time.

First of all, we have spent more than 2h waiting for the check in. Once we were finally about to board the ground staff announced a strike of baggage handling personnel. At that stage they have advised that there is no confirmation of how long this might take. Few minutes after this they called all passengers to inform us that the departure will be at 12.55 which we also confirmed once again with the ground staff. We removed ourselves from the gate in the anticipation of the flight. At 12.10 we return to the gate, only to find out that the flight has departed! You can imagine our shock and disbelief. I was not the only passenger affected. Staff were absolutely not welcoming nor understanding, her explanation was resting her shoulders - and that she was not aware what the other person at the gate conveyed to us. At this stage we were re-directed to the customer services of Brussels Airlines for support. After 45 minutes on the phone, the customer service advised us to visit the Ticketing Office at the airport. The only problem is that such office at Copenhagen airport does not exist. The nice gentleman over the phone insisted that the re-booking can't be made over the phone and whilst he seemed understanding of the situation he was still directing us the non existing ground staff for rebooking and the conversation was not helpful at all. The only ticketing services available were from SAS, but they re-confirmed that only Brussels Airlines can do it or else Aviator. Then we went to Aviator again, which has sent us to Lufthansa check in. The problem with that is, that Lufthansa does not have a flight till tomorrow and there is not one single person at the check in counter. After 3 h on the airport, and having spoken to more than 10 people at 6 counters we had no option than to find a hotel for the night and to book the earliest flight to Brussels - all at our own expense.

I was super confused as I did take my first flight and was now in Belgium without a flight home. I called the customer service line and was connected to a call centre in India. I told the representative over the phone what had happened, thinking there was a mistake, they would apologize and reinstate my existing flight.

What is more, we landed with even MORE delay, which is quite an achievement since arrival times are normally pessimistic.

The first question you have to ask with this alrline - the national airline of Cameroon, is ''will the flight actually happen''? Outwards things were not too bad. The return was another matter. The flight from Maroua to Douala was cancelled as the scheduled 737 was out of action. A 757 was scheduled for the next day, but it meant travelling to another airport three hours away by coach as the runway at Maroua is too short for a 757. The coach left Maroua at 05.00 for a flight from Garoua at around midday. On arriving at Garoua we were told the flight would now be at 16.00, maybe. The plane actually arrived around 18.00 and we took off around 19.00. There was absolute chaos on boarding, and I had to physically fight to get on the plane - a very frightening experience. After an unscheduled stop at Yaoundé for a hour we eventually arrived at Douala around 23.00. The only positive was that the Cabin crew were charming and helpful under stress.

It took them forever to confirm my new flights and send me a new itinerary. I had to call them again 1-2 weeks before the trip to ask for an update and even then, not all of reservations were confirmed. My flight from Saskatoon to Vancouver apparently needed an update from the Hong Kong team who needed to connect with Air Canada. That again took extremely long. I had to call them almost every single day to ask about the flight just to get the same response of ''Don't worry, you are assured to get on the flight'' or ''We still need to her back from the Hong Kong Team'' or ''We will call you as soon as we have any update''. Up until 3 days before the trip, I did not receive a single call or email regarding the issue. On that day, I had to call them constantly for 5 hours, talking to numerous agents without being to make any progress. And, at the last minute, they informed me that the flight was no longer in their system. Apparently, Air Canada decided to prioritize their passengers and I couldn't get on the flight anymore despite having requested it months ago. This miscommunication between airlines COST ME $600 to book myself a last-minute flight with another airline (Westjet) from Saskatoon to Vancouver to catch other flights. That was the cheapest ticket I could find which unfortunately left a day early than my planned trip. So I had to stay at the Vancouver airport more than 24 hours. And since it was too sudden, I could not make any hotel reservations and had to sleep on a wooden bench in a food court where people talked throughout the night. Also, due to the small number of Cathay Pacific flights from Vancouver to anywhere else, there was not a single agent I could talk to in person. I couldn't even check in my luggage early and had to sleep with two 23-kg boxes and 2 extra carry ons. I was extremely disappointed with Cathay Pacific. Initially, I thought their customer service was good as they were nice and tried to book new flights for me when I requested. But, their inability to communicate with other airlines or even among their teams slowed everything to an extreme. To make it even worse, their refund/compensation policy makes no sense. They couldn't fly me out to Vancouver but they reused to give me a refund for that particular flight. They told me that if I wanted a refund, I would need to cancel the trip for a complete refund. Now, I don't know who I talk to about this issue to demand a fair explanation and compensation.

"Cebu Pacific";2;"'''I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards'''";"15th December 2022";"VERDADERO";"' The Cebu Pacific website disconnects, times out, and stops loading a lot. I think they just didn't set it up to handle online traffic very well. It disrupted my booking constantly and worse, didn't process my payment properly so the booking was not confirmed, yet I was charged on my credit card. Their customer service is a Facebook chat and the staff are unfortunately not even trusted by their company with anything to do with my account so not very much help at all when I had to open a dispute on the charge since they never fixed that charge (to this day, months later and I had to book a second time, still unresolved and waiting for dispute case). The customer service help desk shouldn't be a Facebook chat - should be an actual phone line and their staff should be trained on account matters. Also their website currently is confusing with an ''old'' and ''new'' version for when you want to manage your booking. Certain options can only be done on either versions. The mobile app doesn't work at all. Always has an error. On the actual flight: the NRT>MNL plane does not have reclining seats and they do offer meals but you have to buy them. So if you are going to be hungry, eat before your board. While they were serving the snacks, I normally am okay and indifferent to the smell of instant noodles but somehow on that flight, it was just overpowering since we're in an enclosed space. After some time and just before our stomachs were going to turn inside out, thankfully the staff sprayed something in the air that eliminated the odor but I think serving such a strong smelling food is not good for flights in my opinion. The only thing I think that I can say is positive is that their check-in staff and cabin attendants were professional the entire time. I get they are a budget airline and for prices to be cheap, you compromise a lot on things but I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards that other budget airlines do. So be wary of booking with them. If your budget allows for a bit more, try another airline for your route.'";"A321";"Couple Leisure";"Economy Class";"Narita to Manila";2022-01-11 00:00:00;10;30;10;30;10;10;20;"no"

My connecting flight, which was supposed to depart at 04.55, was delayed until 10.10 am (without explanation). The airline bought one free McDonald's meal for every customer, but in my opinion, that did not make up for a 5 hour delay. 2. When I made my booking, it was made clear that there would be no food available on the flight. However, once on the flight, I noticed that other passengers had been able to pre-book meals. It would have been nice if this option were available to me to - would have saved me from having to buy food at ridiculous prices in Dubai airport. 3. I understand that this is a budget airline, but the low cost is not worth the discomfort. The seats are tiny and do not recline. There is no inflight entertainment. This flight was almost 10 hours long and it was incredibly uncomfortable. The restrooms were dirty and smelled bad. 4. When we landed in Manila, the captain announced that because of the red thunder, there would be a slight delay in de-boarding. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the terminal we were supposed to use for de-boarding was occupied by another airline because of the disruption of the thunderstorm. He said we would wait for 10-15 minutes. This went on for two hours, with him periodically announcing that it would only be another 10-15 minutes. After the 6 hour delay and almost 10 hour flight, this pushed me past my breaking point. The pilot said it was beyond their control. I don't know if I believe that, but even if that were true, the airline/pilot could surely have come up with something better than repeating the same lie for two hours.

"CityJet";1;"CityJet customer review";"20th June 2014";"FALSO";"Early January to celebrate an anniversary my husband and I decided to visit Dresden and booked a pre-flight hotel close by to LCY airport and seven nights in a hotel in Dresden. We booked with CityJet to fly off on 9/6/2014 and return on 16/6/2014. In April 2014 we received an email from CityJet to say there was a reschedule to 24 hours later on both flights. We were not prepared to pay the increase to double the cost of our London hotel booked at this later date and so we had to lose this luxury we had planned. My husband went to LCY airport to check all was well and took along a hard copy of the email of the reschedule information. At the CityJet desk it was confirmed that we were booked on the 9/6/2014 and 16/6/2014 flights. He informed the desk clerk that there were no flights on these dates and he was told that we were not booked on flights on 10/6/2014 or 17/6/2014 and that he should phone the 0871 telephone number on the reschedule email. He suggested that the clerk should do this for him. After 25 minutes on the phone-apparently due to a computer problem-the information was corrected. Obviously this situation was stressful but things seemed to go smoothly from thereon. However on our return when we went to the passport control to prepare to board our flight to LCY we were informed by the passport controllers that our flight was cancelled and advised us to return to the check in desk. Here they knew nothing of the cancellation and had to make enquiries. After a short time were told there were technical problems with the flight leaving London and it had to return to the LCY airport and another plane will fly us to LCY in 2 hours time. Instead of 13.25 we left Dresden at 15.45. The flight staff were good but no more CityJet for us for a while I think.";;;"Economy Class";;;50;50;20;;10;;10;"no"

Travelling with a child under two years I was glad to see that Cityjet charges ''only'' 3 EUR for the child travelling on your lap. Concerning the fact that we had to check in one bag (which costs an extra 15 EUR when doing it during online check-in - completely ok) I tried to check-in online as offered by the airline. Stupid enough that during this process I get the information that online check-in is not possible when travelling with a child under the age of two. This bumped the costs of our checked-in bag up to 30 EUR because we had to do it at the airport. With two flights this makes 30 extra Euro just because we were travelling with a child on our lap - not occupying a seat. So in fact the child was travelling for 33 EUR. Cityjet states in its policies that every child under the age of two may carry one piece of baggage up to 10 kg a stroller and a car seat. When we arrived at the airport we were told that only the stroller was allowed. Neither the car seat nor the 10 kg bag could be taken on the airplane - unless we paid for it.

"Copa Airlines";1;"'''absolutely shameful and disgraceful'''";"24th October 2022";"VERDADERO";"I'll start by saying I really want to like Copa. The staff is really friendly at airports and on board, and they have a wonderful new terminal at PTY now operational. Unfortunately Copa has a unique ability to fail to think through their processes related to the new terminal and completely ruin the passenger experience as a result. They've completely snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and my experience which I'll relay here is nothing short of Orwellian and bizarre. Having had several subpar experiences at the old terminal (T1), I was really looking forward to using the new terminal (T2) on this trip PTY-MDE-PTY. The outbound flight from PTY was a wonderful opportunity to experience it - the terminal is spacious, clean, modern and efficient - everything that the old terminal isn't. Everything worked well from check in to security, passport control and boarding and I was impressed. All Copa flights depart from the new terminal and everything functioned well. I should've cautioned my enthusiasm after my departure experience as I had no idea what awaited me on my return. On the MDE-PTY return for some odd reason that nobody could explain the Copa arrivals came into the old terminal, which struck me as odd. Why would you build a beautiful new terminal and not use it for all of your flights. Be that as it may, the flight arrived at the old terminal, and I went down to passport control and got through quickly but when I wound up in baggage claim to collect my bag I was astounded to hear that the Copa bags are all delivered to the new terminal. So there I was through passport control and in baggage claim and learned I was in the wrong place. I had to exit baggage claim, make my way to the new terminal via a severely under air-conditioned bus or walk in 30 degree heat and rain. I finally got to T2 but because the baggage claim area is secure, it was not possible to freely enter to collect my bag. Airport personnel insisted I solicit help from Copa to get me inside to get my bag. I spoke with about 6 different Copa employees and spent approximately 30 minutes gaining access. The Copa employees were helpful but not terribly sympathetic. They told me it was totally my fault (blame the customer) that I didn't know the bags were to be delivered and collected at T2 despite a T1 arrival. In my defense I heard no announcement on board, was sent no notification via email or text, was told nothing about this when I checked in for the flight, was given no piece of paper that explained this in Spanish or English, there were no Copa employees who met the plane at the old terminal to advise us to stay airside to go to T2 to collect our bags, and nobody in passport control or baggage claim to explain, no screens advising. In short there was no communication on behalf of the airline to assist passengers. Logically any passenger who arrives in one terminal would expect their bag to arrive in the same terminal. This logic was completely lost on all airport and airline personnel as I tried to collect my bag. I simply cannot understand nor accept that the airline and airport are not at fault by choosing to build a new terminal then not use it, force passengers to walk 1 km in the heat to collect their bags at another terminal and then implementing a a scheme that provides zero information about this to passengers at any stage in the process.

I was told in the airport that our connecting flight in Panama to Miami will also be delayed so that we can make it to Miami same day. They proceeded to say that because it is weather related Copa works well with their customers and makes arrangements to delay connecting flights if needed. We were assured that we would get home same day. I traveled with my husband and three minor children, 10 yrs old, 6 yrs old, and 4 months old. We checked in our luggage, including the infants stroller, straight to Miami. Well upon arrival in Panama we were instructed to make huge lines to speak to Copa staff at the counter. Upon seeing this and carrying my baby I walked to the front of the line and spoke to the Supervisor, and asked for assistance since I had a 4 month. Well the supervisor was clearly frustrated and in a bad mood and took that out on me and my family. She told me to look behind at the line and that I needed to make the line. Well I told her that I take priority because of the baby as it had been the entire vacation while traveling. She told me to sit down that she would be with me whenever she could. About 15 minutes went by, me standing there with my 4 month old baby, and she never once looked my way nor did she assist. Finally the other staff member next to her called me over. We then were hit with the surprise that their were no other flights leaving that night and that we would be leaving the next day. At this time I asked for a hotel stay and she responded ''Copa doesn't cover hotel stay due to weather delays''. At this point I was livid. After paying $1800 for our flights, checking in our bags and stroller to Miami because of incompetent staff, standing at 11pm in the Panama airport with no clothes, no baby food, no diapers, nothing, and being told ''we needed to figure it out on our own'' is plain disrespectful. I then wrote a complaint to Copa via email and spoke to  Customer Service, which did absolutely nothing despite the awful experience and treatment that I received with my family.  I will never fly Copa again.'";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Punta Cana to Miami via Panama City";2022-01-09 00:00:00;10;10;10;10;10;;10;"no"

Because the AC temperature has been set to 15-16 degrees, we were freezing all the time and on our question if they could increase the temperature the stewardess said: ''maybe, we cant guarantee'' - at the end (10 minutes before landing) she came again to us to tell that now it will be warm again.

On January 12, however, CSA/Travel Service came up with something new: Prague to Ostrava via Košice. The normally 60-minute flight to Ostrava thus took 3 hours and 30 minutes! Passengers to Ostrava were taken all the way to Košice, made to leave the aircraft there, then to board again 20 minutes later and only brought to their destination on the way back to Prague. Huge savings for the carrier, zero respect to cargo. Sorry, I mean to passengers, mainly homeward business travelers on a Friday afternoon. I am appalled at the level of arrogance displayed by the once respectable national carrier. If informed in time, I could have opted for a train ride, which would have brought me home earlier and at a fraction of the cost while pampering me with all the comforts of a modern speed train like WiFi, royal amounts of legroom, nice onboard service and a well stocked dining car. Instead, I was confronted by the grim reality only at the gate minutes before boarding. No options, no choice, no apology, no compensation.

Hotel was booked and only managed 5 hours rest as they arranged a bus to take me to the airport at 6am the next day. Arriving at the airport found out they had rebooked me onto a Hong Kong Airlines flight (it was my first time flying with them and they were wonderful) but it was due to depart 30mins from the time I was made aware of my new flight! Mad dash through airport security and onto the plane. Overall a very disappointing experience with them.

This time purchase a ticket for my elderly father (we live 5 hrs from the international airport), for May 8, a week previous to the travel day received a msg stating the flight got rescheduled to May 13. A day before the flight I received a message that the new time switched from 3:30pm to 10pm, My father gets to the airport on the May 13 at 6pm and the flight is completely canceled, we did not receive any messages, No emails, no phone calls. I paid someone to take my dad to the airport but the driver is not allowed at the airport so he dropped my father off and left. I called customer services they started it was 11pm and to call back during business hours. I had to jump and literally do magic to have him in the next flight with a different airline. This airline lost my respect and will never purchase another ticket. I called them this morning and their answer was we had to cancel this flight for major reasons. I understand things happen, but be ready to be responsible to take care of your customers and communicate as soon as possible.

"easyJet";1;"'''Worst airline I used so far'''";"18th September 2022";"VERDADERO";"'  At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ''Oh sorry sir'', then the attendant moved on like nothing happened. It only hurt for a bit, it's not like I want monetary compensation or anything for that, but yeah a cup of coffee could have made it up for almost everything.

The Inflight Entertainment consists only of some audio channels. No individual screens so no individual movies no games just two movies on the big screens - unsatisfactory. But the food was great a tasty main dish and lots of ice cream and sandwiches during the flight. Also the crew was friendly and efficient. I consider the inflight economy product on Edelweiss apart from the in-flight entertainment better than the Swiss economy on long haul. But definitely not so the ''Relax'' Class on the return flight which is also sold by Swiss as Business Class. We decided to do so because the flight back was a night flight and we wanted to sleep - it's a complete waste of money. There was separate and fast check-in at Cancun but we had the same latest check-in time than economy what a joke. When we asked for the lounge we were told that there wasn't any for Edelweiss Passengers. That definitely was not a joke. Once aboard the seats looked like old economy seats some 30 years ago. Small ridiculous seat pitch of not even 39 inch that's just 7 inch more than on economy. It was a bit reclinable but probably not more than 45°. I could not stretch my legs and it was impossible to sleep. There were only few newspapers and 2 low-quality gossip magazines. What was not a good alternative to the 6 movies offered in the media player distributed at the beginning of the flight. The only highlight was the food and the drinks offered they were very good. And again the crew were friendly and nice although a bit slow - the first course was served 90 minutes after take-off. But on my opinion not only the passengers but also the crew deserves a better product than this so called ''relax'' class probably they feel very embarrassed to work in such an ambiance.

No comfortable seats. The staff at the airport was the worst, I asked them about my room the guy literally yelled at me. Later after 5 hours, they gave me my hotel along with others. At the hotel there was no veg food. Just bread and salads and vegetables.  The return flight to India had 12 hours lay over this was even more worst than before. Out of the 12 hours i had to wait for 5 hours at the lobby. And even after that, they didnt give me a room saying they didnt approve my transit visa for the hotel.

They don’t engage with passengers and always seem to have an attitude. When serving water, coffee, or tea they do not bother to ask every passenger. They also do not stay on top of safety protocols and I caught three of them playing games on their phones when they should’ve been getting passengers situated. Lastly, they failed to deliver every bag for passengers on the leg from CAI to LOS as they only loaded bags for passengers who flew that same route the day before. Apparently this was because of a load issue that wasn’t even addressed to us until much later on.

We have arrived on the Ben Gurion  Airport around 14:20 and we didn't receive any box with the missing items.

I don’t know if it’s because they don’t pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardess’s are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They don’t want to do any hard work. Can’t even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I don’t know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly.

"Emirates";2;"'''the crew were nowhere to be seen'''";"29th December 2022";"VERDADERO";"My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight.

"Emirates";1;"'''worse than my already very low expectations'''";"2nd December 2022";"VERDADERO";"'  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ''officer'')'";"A380";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Bangkok to London via Dubai";2022-01-12 00:00:00;10;20;20;10;30;10;10;"no"

My claim is mainly because they do not properly notify about the fact that they do not allow holding any small objects in hands which normally are allowed in the cabin by other airlines. I had only one small backpack as hand luggage and my suit (which is whatever but definitely not the second hand luggage). They forced me to pay and give my backpack to the baggage. Normally the airlines do not consider man's suit in a soft case as an additional hand luggage, and the crew hangs it the cabin. But instead I had to put in the shelf. And finally my tripod which was tied up to the backpack was lost. I think it is stolen. And this is the responsibility of the company. It would not be stolen if it was in the cabin under my control.

We went to another counter to verify our visa with the agent name Meron Teklay (I appreciate her handling and she is well experienced) and then returned to the agent to drop off our bags, as we had our boarding passes and luggage stickers. Unfortunately, the agent was rude and refused to let us drop off our luggage, instructing us to go back to the line. It's frustrating that we completed all the necessary procedures but were still not allowed to proceed. I am aware that the Ethiopian government invested a significant amount of money in a smart checking system, but it seems like it is not being utilized effectively. I have personally traveled multiple times with a permanent residence permit for the United States of America and hold Silver Sheba miles status. This experience with Ethiopian Airlines on July 8, 2023, was the worst in terms of customer handling.

The airport upon landing in Addis Ababa was another experience, separate issue. I connected to Harare from Addis Ababa. Upon arrival in Harare I got 1 of my checked in bag and the other one was missing.

So my bag was missing, there was no announcement from the crew that some bags has been left behind, no communication whatsoever. I don't live in Harare, I had to stay in Harare overnight so I could return to the airport the following day to check whether my missing bag was on the next day's flight. Fortunately my bag came on that day's flight, however there was still no communication from the airline or apology whatsoever after the inconvenience.

"Etihad Airways";1;"'''I have learnt my lesson'''";"20th June 2023";"VERDADERO";"BCN-AUH-LHE. Had a flight on 24th May 10.15am departure. After the boarding at BCN they kept us waiting at the boarding gate until 6pm, before announcing that the flight was cancelled due to a technical fault. During that 10 hours ordeal, no one had any decency to inform the passengers of what was going on, they kept changing the departure time with the increments of 1 hours. 1 snack voucher was provided which had a value of 5€, no lunch or drinks were provided. Finally at 6pm they told everyone to collect our baggage and wait at check-in area to be given hotel spaces. The off-loaded baggage arrived after 2 hours which to me was deliberate as they wanted to minimise the time passengers would spend at the hotel. Finally after another 2 hours wait in the queue, they told everyone to wait for buses to be taken to the hotel. The hotel was 1 and a half hour drive outside of Barcelona where we finally reached at 11.30pm. There was no communication as to when we will be picked up for our next day flight etc. At 4am, we were told bus had arrived for us, so hurried to the airport where they checked everyone in for 10.15am departure. At 11am, they told us that the aircraft that had just arrived from AUH to pick us up, was faulty as well. We were all then loaded onto the busses and taken to another aircraft which was parked at a half hour drive on the other side of the airport and finally that departed with the delay of over 2 hours. Abu Dhabi airport is another disgrace, you could smell the toilets from miles away, crowded space with low ceiling and rude staff. The flight to LHE was on a Airbus A320 with no IFE and in the name of in flight meal, they presented us with a bland sandwich. I asked for a diabetic meal in advance but due to cancelled flight and their crap service, never got it. All in all, I will never fly this joke of an airline again and recommend everyone to avoid them. They are not professional, will not communicate with customers if something went wrong and just treat their customers in a worst possible way. Choose Emirates or Qatar like I always do and couldn't do it this time because of last minute travel requirement.

"Etihad Airways";1;"'''they don't seem to really care'''";"30th May 2023";"VERDADERO";"'  Let me share with you the awful experience I had (and still have with Etihad).It started some days before my flight (which was from the 30th of April to 1st of May, from Barcelona to Seoul, with a layoff in Abu Dhabi). Etihad has this offer where you can bid to reserve the seats on your row to have no neighbors during the flight. For my flight from Abu Dhabi to Seoul, I thought it was a good idea to reserve a seat and bid for the two seats next to me to have no neighbors, be more comfortable and get some sleep during the flight. So I bid and got the 2 extra seats reserved for me. They sent me this nice email with this great phrase ''You will enjoy a neighbor-free seat onboard.'' I was very much looking forward to it. My friends, on the same flights, also did it (they were the ones that suggested me) and also got the bid won. Yet, I thought I should not get too happy, maybe they will mess up something...and that's what exactly happened. Two large men came and say: those are our seats and I was no, I reserved them. They politely acknowledge it, although Etihad really assigned them those seats. It was even more confusing because they put to those seats a little paper on the benches' head support saying they were reserved. They tried to sit one man on another reserved seat behind me but the couple that reserved it protested. In the end, the attendant came to me, apologize, and said that they probably had last minute reservation, and the plane was fully booked (not true as my friends and other passengers enjoyed their neighbor's free seat). The attendant told me that he will contact the airline to report the issue ASAP. Later I gave him my contact info on paper with all the details. But nobody contacted me. So I emailed them on the 1st of May, to which they answered: We're currently receiving a high number of emails. Thank you for your patience whilst we work through each case as quickly as possible. If your case requires a response, a member of our team will get back to you within a maximum of 14 days. I still haven't received any news 28 days later. I contacted their support services multiple times on Twitter and every time, they asked me to leave the time to the team to do their investigation. I asked them how long it will take and they stayed vague...In the first email, I also asked them to cancel the reservation I made for the seat I reserved for my flight back because I didn't want to give Etihad more money until my case was solved, but no one answered. Etihad didn't deliver a service I paid for and I strongly recommend to anyone to not bid for blocking a neighbor's seat as they can take it away from you if someone else books a ticket at the last minute, worst, they can take it away from you and make you wait, and not refund you (so far that's what happened to me). I fear I will soon have no choice but to contact a lawyer to get this problem solved.  They should have automatically acknowledged it and refunded me once those seats were taken back from me and given to other passengers. Yet, they leave me with the impression they don't seem to really care. I had issues in the past with other airlines and have always been answered in respectable delays, even during the first month of the covid pandemic that forced many airlines to cancel flights. Etihad has so far not shown me any sign of willingness to refund me. '";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Barcelona to Seoul via Barcelona";2023-01-05 00:00:00;10;10;20;30;40;30;30;"no"

Then you are stuck with a multi-city itinerary that does not allow any changes or cancellations. Customer service won't answer or take any responsibility.

The first leg to Abu Dhabi was with an A350, brand new plane. I must admit that Etihad livery is the best one I’ve seen. Along with on time-ish departure, unfortunately they are the only positive things I can think of. Although the plane was new, the seats are cramped, a thing that I noticed to many other airlines with new planes, and I am definitely not a tall person. They’re just pouring as many seats as possible which is very inconvenient for longer flights. Surprisingly, on the 777 plane from AUH to BKK, although was an older plane, the seats were much more comfortable, thus confirming what I mentioned above. The food onboard was just average, it lacks presentation and quality like you get on Qatar, Emirates or Turkish. IFE was just ok, not too many options to choose from. The crew was not as proactive as the other middle eastern carriers mentioned above. Together with AUH airport experience (an old and tired airport) I must admit that my first experience was not so great with Etihad and I really wanted to love them as they look so stylish (apparently only from outside). I usually fly to Asia only with Qatar and unfortunately Etihad can’t match the other carrier’s overall services, and they are on the same price range.";"A350 / Boeing 777-300ER";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Dublin to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi";2023-01-04 00:00:00;30;20;20;50;30;40;20;"no"

I have been trying to find the forms and the site to submit the necessary paperwork but after two days I was not able to discover anything. Today I called their customer service in Greece and in Emirate and the amazing answer they gave me is that they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi! I told them this was not fair since I am not asking any compensation for the over 24-hour delay involving two passengers but only to pay for my hotel. The answer was still the same no compensation for hotels outside Abu Dhabi. Conclusion: Etihad lied to me in Melbourne about hotel compensation. They did absolutely nothing for the long delay.

On our way back, at the airport, we lined up in the priority line. There was one customer in front of us, nobody behind us. We were in our holiday clothes, not suit and tie. The check in clerk stood up and shouted in German (I speak German) on top of this voice ''This line is only for priority customers, you should join the other line''. 100 heads turned around looking at us, all from the economy line and we looked like criminals. I then said I was business class. His female colleague then asked him if she should see us (him clearly being the supervisor). He told her not to and they let us wait until almost all of the economy line cleared out (like to be punished). When I challenged him about how embarrassing this was rather than apologising he lectured me that he had to keep the line free for business class customers (again like I was not) at which time I shut up and didn't say anything anymore. Also, the lounge in Stuttgart was closed (open in London), there was no proper food or drink on the plane and boarding was a farce with no social distancing and no extra line for priority. Finally busses in Stuttgart packed all the passengers of the whole plane in 1 bus to save on cost not caring about Coronavirus and social distancing in the slightest and drove like they had to win a Grand Prix race. Therefore my advice: 1) If you can fly BA instead, better fly BA economy than Eurowings business and you will be treated much better 2) If you cant avoid flying with them don't book any upgrades, they treat you like cattle anyway. You wont get any decent food neither and the business class lounges are closed.'";;"Family Leisure";"Business Class";"Stuttgart to London Heathrow";2020-01-08 00:00:00;30;20;10;10;;10;30;"no"

When they finally did, they took our passports into a closed office and made us wait outside. Very bad, and not to mention a security risk on so many levels.

We have requested compensation, which is outlined the European Law, in regards to emergency clothing and supplies purchased for the trips since we had no clothes, shoes - only what we had worn on the plane. It's now been 3 weeks and all Evelop have done is consistently ask us for more ''documents''. We originally sent the Irregularity report from the airport (which anyway contains every single detail they actually need to sort out the case) but then they asked us for boarding cards, baggage tags, even a copy of our original reservation with the booking reference! This is so unnecessary and it is very obvious that they are avoiding taking any responsibility whatsoever for the situation.

"Finnair";2;"'''airline removing customer service'''";"28th November 2021";"VERDADERO";"Another airline removing customer service. On a business trip to St. Petersburg, Russia for a week, decided to pay a little extra for flexible tickets in case I would finish up early - and I did. Go to the Finnair site a few days ahead of return tip, select an earlier flight and get told the fee for the new ticket would be 0 - excellent. When confirming the change a generic error message comes up, and the site does not allow me to do anything further. I immediately try contacting their customer chat but after navigating the chatbot menus for a few minutes it puts me in line for an operator then immediately hangs up because the volume of requests is too high. The next day I log on to their site again, and this time my new flight shows up under the booking - great! I then reasonably assume the change went through as planned, and that the error only came at a later step in the process. A few more days of my trip pass until it's time to check-in, and only when trying to do so does another error message appear telling me I can't check-in and to contact Finnair specifically at a number in Finland. Obviously calling an overseas customer service number is pretty annoying with queues and all, but I do so and spend 30 minutes waiting to no avail - no queue number is given, only that they are currently receiving an exceptional number of requests. At this point I am running out of time but feel my best bet at actually getting service will be at the airport counter itself, so I make sure to arrive there with an hour extra to spare. There is no Finnair staff at the airport, but the local Russian ground staff are very helpful - basically explaining that the system says I need to pay a EUR100 fee to complete the rebooking. This was not the info I was given on the Finnair site when requesting the rebook, and does not make sense with my ticket category having free rescheduling, but after spending 90 minutes at the airport trying to sort this out - with both ground staff and myself trying to reach Finnair - I relent and pay the extra fee instead of missing my flight entirely. I obviously know it will be a nightmare to reclaim this from the airline later, but I swear to at least try. On my return flight I have a connection in Helsinki, Finnair's home airport, so here I figure at least I can talk to their staff in person and get a little more clarity. I don't have time to leave the security area and seek out the ticketing office, but I track down two of Finnair's transfer desks at least, but they are both unmanned! Since returning home last night I have tried their chat twice more, again I get disconnected immediately because the volume of requests is too high. I obviously cannot find an email address to contact them at, and I simply don't have the patience to be in a phone queue for hours. So in sum - multiple individuals (me, my wife, airport ground staff) have tried to reach Finnair through multiple means (phone, chat, in-person at home airport) without any luck - all to understand why their website has failed to rebook my flight at the listed price, then not informed about the issue they created either so I could address it prior to actually traveling. If you want to be one of those digital companies with 0 customer interaction, then at least make a website that works.";;"Business";"Economy Class";"St Petersburg to Stockholm via Helsinki";2021-01-11 00:00:00;30;40;40;10;;30;20;"no"

Instead offered me an overnight stay in a hotel in Kota Bharu and a ride in a cab to it. I tried to explain that my costs are higher than the stay in a rundown hotel and a cab ride there, They would like to find a reasonable solution for both sides and that would be a transport on the same day to my vacation destination. Long story short, I would have to pay for the additional boot transfer myself and could then submit this we hotline and e-mail. One will then consider this separately due to the delays and circumstances. This I did, however I got a ridiculous answer and they offered me a refund of 200 MYR from the 580 MYR I had already paid, which is not even half of my costs.

When I said I wasn't changed on the way there the attendant rudely replied ''Well if you don't pay you're not getting on''. This is after I paid to upgrade.  They seated me in-between two toddlers which the flight attendants allowed to run around the aircraft, knock on the pilots cabin door several times, also allowed them to climb all over me even though I asked both the parents and the flight attendants to please stop allowed them to run wild like this. It is an aircraft, not a daycare. I fly several times a year and usually go with United or Air Canada. This time I thought I'd try to ''save'' a couple dollars by flying this airline but when all was said and done with these stupid carry on bag fees, which I have never been charged for a backpack before for ANY other airline, it worked out to be the same as any other airline. Save the headache and go for a different airline. Also the app never works.

And to my very surprise I then found out that they actually loaded my bike on same flight as I was booked on! Many of my colleagues never called to confirm booking and they got their bicycles on the plane, for free with no hassle. I was furious. Why did I have to pay all this extra money.

My cancellation mail arrived on 12th March 2020 from Flynas Airlines Flight Adjustment Department. According to the mail, I could call their call center to get more information. I tried to call Flynas Call Center however, their call center was not accessible because no one picked up the phone. Indeed, I mailed their customer service unit but I did not get any response. I had to book a flight at the last minute from Delhi to Istanbul. I had to fly a different airport than my previous airport because other options were way above my budget. I had an extra flight from Sabiha Gokcen Airport so that I had to rush between these airports. When I came back to my home town after a terrible journey I still did not get any response from their customer service unit. So that I called Flynas call center. When I talked to the Flynas they refused to refund my money. They informed me that they translated my ticket into a mile point and I had only one option which uses these miles on the next flight. I did not accept their rules because I knew that a refund was my legal right in this situation. I tried to explain that I was not a Saudia Arabia citizen and I did not live in Saudia Arabia so that I could not use these miles. When I requested to refund my money again they advised me to contact Flynas customer service unit. I called them and mail them but there was not any response from Flynas customer service unit. I reached their call center again and explained that Flynas customer service did not answer my emails and phone calls. This process continued three times, I mail or call their customer service unit a hundred times but there was no answer. I paid 230 SAR phone bill because of these phone calls. In summary, I was victimized by Flynas company and threatened unfairly.

"FlySafair";1;"'''worst customer service'''";"4th October 2018";"VERDADERO";"Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth. On 21/09/2018 I had one of the worst customer service experiences with Safair at OR Thambo International Airport. Not only were their staff inexperienced and incompetent but they were extremely rude and unhelpful with a situation where I was innocent. I missed my flight out of Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth, flight FA360, departing at 18:20. A few factors contributed to this flight being missed and are as follows: Delays and Cancellations at ORT: Most of the flights posted on the flight screens were either delayed or cancelled on Friday evening. The assumption was that due to the public holiday, the airport was facing congestion. Flights that were meant to depart at 15:15, 15:25, 16:00 etc were showing as either 'Boarding', 'Departing', 'Cancelled' or 'Delayed' at +- 18:00 2. Flight Screens: The flight screens at ORT were clearly out of order (as per the above point) and so flights that may have looked to be 'delayed' were in fact departing and flights that were ‘cancelled’ may have in fact been 'departing'. This was confirmed by Safair team members at the departure gate for flight FA360. Gate Change: The flight screens at ORT had flight FA360 departing from gate E6 (this being the bottom level of gates at ORT) where I had positioned myself at 17:45 in order to be at the gate 5 minutes before the gates opened. For the next +- 20 minutes nothing changed on the flight screens. The was no 'Go to Gate' sign for flight FA360 and the gate remained unchanged at E6 on the flight screens. The flight screen at Gate E6 was showing a flight for Margate and so due to the numerous delays and cancellations at the airport, I was under the impression that the Port Elizabeth flight would depart after this Margate flight at Gate E6. This was not the case. At approximately 18:15 when I once again looked at the flight screens, the gate for flight FA360 had changed to gate C13. There was no ‘Go to Gate’ sign showing on that flight. I rushed to Gate C13 only to find the flight screen at the gate displaying Flight FA360 to Port Elizabeth as ‘Closed’. When I approached the 2 Safair employees, the 2 ladies had told me that the flight had departed. When asked if there was a Gate change, they both replied ‘Yes’ there was a gate change. When asked ‘why there was no loud speaker informing passengers of this change?’, they replied that there was an employee of the airport telling people about the gate change. I then asked these 2 ladies if the flight screens are not working at the airport as the 'Go to Gate' sign was not visible and the Gate Change only came on at 18:15. Both of them replied that ORT had been having issues with their monitors. What since ensued at the Safair counter at OR Thambo is inexplicable and I simply cannot type out my anger at your Safair staff. The call centre staff also could not assist me with anything and blamed me for 'missing' my flight and have told me that I am in the wrong. Its actually a disgrace how I have been treated by such a 'reputable' company.";;"Business";"Economy Class";"Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth";2018-01-09 00:00:00;10;10;;10;;;10;"no"

Not to mention old people who had no means of additional transport nor accommodation that time of night! Cash refunds were refused, which meant you were forced to use Flysafair the next day. Flying Safair has cost us an additional R5000 in one day and we never reached our destination as booked online at least 2 months before the time. There were many different excuses for cancelling the flight.

"French Bee";1;"'''Never, ever fly French Bee'''";"11th July 2022";"VERDADERO";"' This airline is a scam. Because of a last-minute family emergency, I booked a flight through edreams from Nice to LAX. It had a two hour layover. I checked in online the night before, but the French Bee's website wouldn't allow me to print a ticket. I figured two hours would be plenty of time. My flight landed on time, and my French Bee flight was supposed to leave at 15.20. When I arrived at Orly, I was informed by the gate agents that they: 1) Had moved up the flight 30 minutes early, 2) Therefore, I could not print my boarding pass or check my bag (even though I was there an hour and a half before the scheduled departure), 3) I would have to purchase a new ticket. The gate agents were also the rudest I ever encountered - I was begging them to be let on the flight, as I could have made it, and they laughed and wouldn't help me. They directed me to an hour long line full of 30 other passengers who also weren't allowed to board their flight. As I had an emergency, I ended up booking another flight from Air France and lost about 3,000 euro. When I contacted customer service, they condescendingly told me that ''this is how the airline industry works.'' I fly around 20-30 times a year - most other airlines close check in 30-45 minutes before boarding, and will at least try to get you on your flight. French Bee appears to actively encourage customers to miss their flight, so they can double-charge them on a second ticket. This is not how the airline industry works, these are unethical business practices. And the other reviews & passengers who missed their flights indicate that the problem is French Bee, not us. I am desperately trying to get a refund, but French Bee has refused me. My travel insurance won't cover it because I was technically checked in. There is no help, just a lesson for you: Never, ever fly French Bee. The low fares are a scam.

I was never informed only 50% of my expenses would be covered prior to incurring my expenses. 5) When I call French Bee customer service line, they refuse to discuss the matter with me, telling me they don’t handle customer service complaints like this over the phone and I can only handle it via email.

"Frontier Airlines";1;"'''misleading and deceptive practice'''";"30th June 2023";"VERDADERO";"'  Frontier is not and will never be my go to airline, but I went to them because I recently purchased their Summer Go Wild Pass that I have only been able to use once. The pass allows you to fly for about $15 each way but you are only allowed a personal item (which is about the size of a kids backpack and you cant choose your seat.) anything else will cost extra. Apparently they made changes to their website to now almost no flights are available for anyone using the Go Wild Pass but the seats are available if I were purchasing a regular ticket. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration with the Frontier Summer Go Wild pass, which I recently purchased in good faith. It is with the utmost disappointment that I bring to your attention the sheer unavailability of flights for the utilization with this pass, rendering it effectively worthless. This has not only wasted my time and money but also tarnished my perception of Frontier Airlines as a reliable and customer oriented airline. Despite the enticing proposition of enjoying flights for a mere $0.01 each, I have found that almost every flight that I attempt to book using the Go Wild pass is inexplicably marked as ''not available.'' This flagrant lack of availability stands in stark contrast to the same flights being readily accessible for regular purchase. The fact that the flights I am interested in are supposedly accessible under normal circumstances only deepens my exasperation. Let me emphasize the tremendous inconvenience and emotional distress caused by this egregious issue. As a customer, I places my trust in Frontier Airlines when I opted to purchase the Go Wild Pass, expecting a fair opportunity to utilize the benefits promised. Regrettably, my experience thus far has been nothing short of an elaborate hoax, leaving me with a sense of betrayal and frustration.

"Frontier Airlines";1;"'''not worth the cheap ticket'''";"27th June 2023";"VERDADERO";"'  On June 26, 2023, my flight to Trenton NJ, via Raleigh Durham, was cancelled. No explanation was given, but we found out later it was due to severe thunder storms. This can't be helped. We were told at the gate to go back to the ticket counter to re-book or cancel. I went to ticketing and asked a Frontier agent where I needed to be for re-booking. Her response was ''Over there''. She didn't indicate where 'over there' was, so I asked again. Same response. I said, ''Do you mean behind this woman (who was in line)?'', and she said ''No. Over there where the person in green is standing''. So I moved over to the end of the line. One by one we were moved to another line for rebooking and after about 30 minutes, I, too, was moved. I stood there for another 20-30 minutes when a Frontier employee walked over to us and informed us that if we were to re-book, we needed to be in the original line, the one we'd all just left. I tried to ask him if we were expected to go to the end of the line, but he interrupted me and said he would answer question once we all moved. I tried again. Same thing. Another passenger tried for clarification, and again, the very rude response. And once again, someone tried to ask, and once again, he interrupted before the gentleman had a chance to get his question out. I finally said that I was not going to the end of the line because I'd already been there once, and he then told me, ''Then you won't be re-booked''. Not one of us was angry or rude or disrespectful. We were appalled at his behavior toward us but no one was complaining about the cancelled flight or the long line. Some folks had been there for two days. Of the dozen or so standing around me, we all commented to one another that we would never fly Frontier again. After moving over to 'the other' line, I went back to the Frontier employee and asked his name. He interrupted again, saying he'd answer questions when we were all in line. I told him I didn't have a question other than could I please have his name. At that point he looked at me and said, ''I don't have to give you my name''. That's when I cancelled my ticket. Never, in my 72 years, have I witness such complete and utter disrespect to a group of people, and for no reason. Frontier Airlines deserves the terrible reputation it has. It's run on a bate and switch mentality. Just take a look at it's website. It has absolutely no regard for it's customers. Try finding a phone number where you can actually speak to someone. It's airline employees must hate their jobs, if their 'customer service' is any indication. I'm fully aware that these employees had probably had a couple of tough days, but what about the woman in front of me who had been trying for two days to get back to her kids? There was no respect or regard for her at all. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. They should be ashamed of themselves for the total lack of professionalism they display.

The first three flights were all in Economy class. While the flights were all fairly good, we didn’t feel the food and service to be quite up to the standard of other carriers that we’ve used. But our main issue was that after we had boarded and were seated in Economy prior to departure on the Shenzhen to Brisbane flight, which was a night flight, there was an announcement asking any passengers who wished to upgrade to Business class to contact one of the flight attendants. As we were both fairly tired and the Economy section of the airplane was almost full, we thought we might treat ourselves to an upgrade if the cost was reasonable. So I approached one of the flight attendants to find out what the cost of upgrading would be, and she asked to see our boarding passes to check what our fare class was. After a short while, she came back with one of her colleagues and said that it would cost 5,000 CNY (Chinese Yuan) each to upgrade. Just to make sure that there was no misunderstanding, I wrote down “10,000 ¥? on a piece of paper and asked them if that was the total cost for my wife and myself and they said “Yes.? So we decided to go ahead with the upgrade and we were moved to Business class which was less than half full. However, when we were about to pay by credit card we were told that the cost of upgrading would be 6,800 CNY each. When we told them we had been quoted 5,000 CNY each before we moved, they said that would have only been the case if we had been on a higher fare class. In other words, we had been given incorrect information earlier, but the flight attendants were not prepared to say that someone had made a mistake. At that stage, the flight was about to take off and we didn’t particularly feel like going all the way back to our original seats so we decided to stay in Business class, pay the full amount and to make a complaint to the airline when we got back to Australia. Business class was very comfortable and we both slept well on the way to Brisbane. Also, the flight attendant who was looking after us was very attentive to our needs. After we arrived back home we emailed Hainan Airlines asking for a refund of 3,600 CNY. They apologized for their mistake but refused to provide any compensation.  I’m rating our flight experience at only 5 out of 10, primarily because of the way we were misled.";"A330-200";"Couple Leisure";"Business Class";"Shenzhen to Brisbane";2019-01-06 00:00:00;40;40;30;30;;;10;"no"

We filed a 'irregular baggage report' and did the standard protocol. The man at the desk said they would call first thing the following day and let us know our bag whereabouts. The next morning we received no call so decided to call the aiport as we where staying 1.5 hours from the airport. We were put on hold for 3.5 hours and then 2 hours where no one picked up the phone. The following day was the same! On hold for 3 hours and no answer. When someone finally answered they said they had found the bag and would send it out immediately. 2 days later we still hadn't received the bag and once again couldn't get through on the phone to anyone at the airport. We ended up driving to the airport where there were 3 staff working on the hawaiian airline baggage desk not serving anyone talking amongst themselves.

"Hawaiian Airlines";1;"'''customer service incredibly bad'''";"23rd September 2022";"VERDADERO";"Where do I begin… arrived at airport before start of boarding. Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said that’s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats… If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well… nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. We’ll it happens… Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- “So, what are the options now??. Answer now is “You’ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and it’s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning… what are my options? Answer was “well you can take the room and voucher or not… that’s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, we’re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was “file a complaint?. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty. Food was by far the worse I’ve had on an airplane, and almost all levels of customer service were incredibly bad. I’ve never seen an airline with staff so uninterested in what they do. I do have to note their in-cabin crew was very nice. They seemed to have truly tried to help. Everyone else was god-awful.

This company was drafted in to replace the original Thomas Cook flight (MT2817). The flight was due to take off at 17.00 but we didn’t start boarding until nearly 17.00. Like most people, we didn’t rush as we had boarding passes with allocated seat numbers. Some people had also paid more for extra leg room seats. As we boarded the plane the cabin crew told us to just sit anywhere! This led to chaos and contributed to the delays in taking off. A storm then rolled in and at 17.55 the captain confirmed that we wouldn’t be taking off. There was no further information until 18.39 when he announced that there a was sick child on board and asked for assistance. At 19.08 a Thomas Cook/Condor plane landed in the storm. At 19.31 the captain announced that the child and parents would be leaving the plane but it wasn’t until 19.58 that the baggage belt arrived to start removing the bags. At 20.46 the captain announced that we would finally be leaving. At 20.50 the Thomas Cook plane took off – ahead of us! At 21.21 we finally took off – 4.5 hours after boarding. The cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything – not even the seating. We heard of several fights breaking out and there could well have been many more. The seats were cramped and there was no leg room. The selfish person in front of me pushed their seat back resulting in absolutely no leg room at all. My knees were crushed against the back of their seat for over 8 hours. There is no way I could have placed myself into the brace position (see image). I pointed this out to the cabin crew who, as usual, couldn’t care less. There was no entertainment at all and the only food offered was a roll with very little inside it. The only drink offered by the crew was water, however, we discovered 6 hours into the flight that hot drinks were available near the back. None of the crew bothered to tell us and we had to get up and get it ourselves This is without doubt the worst flight were have ever had to endure. The whole experience had left us reluctant to fly again. Hi-Fly should not be used as a replacement service again – they simply aren’t up to the standards required for even basic air travel.

I didn't had time to feel relieved because I asked for her name, as a means of evidence that a valid staff member gave me this information, and she refused it to tell me multiple times. Seeing that I was getting nowhere and because I was short on time I left and called the customer support as soon as I got back home. Did that, provided all the details I've mentioned and they told me I will receive an email and eventually my money back in around 3 working days. Initially they said they don't have any refund policy except if the request for refund was made in the same day as the payment. That sounded a bit off, taking in consideration what the agency staff lady told me earlier, but fortunately for me I was complying with this constraint. I tried to point out that is extremely unprofessional to have collaborating agencies in which the staff is comfortable to lie/misguide when it comes to the airline policies just to avoid a certain situation.

The last stint was operated by Latam. The flights itself were fine and on time, the food was decent, there could have been more service during the long haul flight. The customer service however is an absolute nightmare. It started with their agent at Munich airport. He assured me multiple times during the checking that my bags were checked all the way to Talara and as proof gave me the bag tags with destination “TY?. I asked multiple times whether I had to take out the bags in Lima to clear customs and he declined. In Talara my bags weren’t there. I filed the form with the staff at the small local airport and ever since (3 days now) am waiting for my bags. Since Latam operated the last flight it is their responsibility to retrieve the luggage according to Iberia. That has been their standpoint during all calls I made. Latam however says they are only retrieving the bags out of curtesy since they were supposed to clear customs in Lima - hence not their fault that they weren’t on the flight. After I saw Talara airport I was sure that the information given to me in Munich was false. Talara is a small domestic airport with no customs. If international baggage could be checked all the way here smuggling would be super easy. I still have no idea how this fact was not known by the agent in Munich. As a customer you feel helplessly lost between two companies which both blame each other for being responsible. I would have expected more from Iberia's customer service than stubbornly repeating that it is Latam's responsibility. Especially since right now the baggage seems to be stuck in Lima with Iberia and the Talara airport stuff says that there are problems receiving the luggage from them for transport. In summary: fly with them but triple check any information their agents give you - it might be plainly false and you have no proof or anything if you simply rely on their spoken advice. Funny sidenote: only after the third call to their customer service they admitted the baggage should have been retrieved in Lima.

They started moving passengers left and right to balance the plane, just during take off and landing, then we could go back to our seats. The crew looked confused and dumb, like they didn't know what they were doing (because they didn't).

The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.? She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself.

Flght AIJ2811 departed with 1h15 delay from Montreal where we all had to wait in a very cold corridor, standing up, or lying down, with no access to a bathroom, with crying babies, then they decided, we would board (15 min. before midnight) and for unknown reason they decided that the flight would be diverted to Cancun to fill the tank. We were supposed to get to MEX at 3h25 am. Result: we landed in Mexico more than 3hrs later, I had hired and paid for a taxi through Booking) to pick me up between 5h and 6h am. The driver waited until 4h30 and then decided to leave, Result I lost the fee for that taxi driver and then had to pay for another one from the taxi pool which is not advisable for a woman alone in Mexico. 2, On Nov. 2, I got an e-mail from Interjet that my flight was now Mexico to Montreal, Being now aware that they do change the flights at a whim, I thought that they managed to give me a direct flight to Montreal instead of the 2 flights trip I had bought. So the taxi delivered me to the area for International departures of Interjet. But no, after waiting in line for a good half hour, Seems it was a mistake, that my previous booking was still standing. So I rushed to the national departures (about the distance of a football field to cross) for my flight that was supposed to leave at 11h am. 3. But no worry that flight was late.(fl. 2370) It left at 1h45, We landed in Cancun at close to 3h00, I had to collect my luggage at the conveyor and re-register it and then had to go through security once again and then, realising that Cancun time was an hour later, I arrived at gate 56 to be told that the plane had just left.

Re-crossing the whole airport again, they gave me another ticket back to Mexico (which left later than scheduled) with a ransfer for Montreal at 1h00 am (fl. 2811) (which actually left at 2h40 am). In conclusion I had 3 flights, spent 27 hrs in planes or at airports on that day and arrived a whole day later than expected. All because the first flight of the day was late) 5. Upon arrival in Montreal, my luggage which was alright when I re-registered it in Cancun, had been opened, the lock was gone and they broke one of the wheels, so it is a total loss.

This time the plane was a Portuguese company with their own staff. They did not answer the call button. The flight had a stopover in England for refueling which we were not told about. They also did not have any sort of order or pattern which was obvious when it came to food. One side would be served about 15 minutes before the other side. And the food was either scalding hot (I burned my finger tips trying to get the lid off) or it was cold. The return flight was 17 hours long and we got 2 very small meals the entire time. When I say small vegetarian breakfast consisted of 2 cherry tomatoes and 3 cucumber slices some olives and a packet of soy product which tasted so sweet it was unbearable. They had 'muffins' and 'fruit' for a few hours between dinner and lunch. On the way there they did give us slippers that were useful and on the way back we got an inflatable pillow and eye mask.

Unfortunately, after booking and upon inspection of her travel document, she discovered a typographical error in her first name.

We made repeated attempts to rectify this situation and get the typo corrected. We contacted GoToGate by phone and email multiple times. We contacted JAL by phone and email multiple times. We drove to the airport in San Diego and asked for help at the JAL desk. We contacted Alaska Air. Though our efforts did receive some replies, none were satisfactory. The typo remains on the ticket. Given the fact that TSA or the Airline may stop her at Airport Security Screening, or stop her from boarding the flight, she is not willing to use the ticket. Therefore, we have requested a full refund for the amount of the ticket, minus an appropriate handling fee, so that her booking via Go To Gate on Alaska and JAL will available, and so that some other passenger may book travel on the seat. We believe that the airline and the travel agency have a moral obligation and responsibility to serve customers to the best of their abilities, and to rectify this kind of situation. Moreover, both the airline, the travel agency, and other customers stand to benefit by allowing the seat to be used by another customer.

When we got to NRT, the connecting flight has not yet departed, and was still boarding, but instead of guiding us to the gate so that we can be on board quickly (which may take approx. 10 mins), they threw us to another airline, with an additional transit (KL) and additional 10 hours flight and waiting at the KL airport. What is even more frustrating is the JAL staff who gave us the new ticket, she said in the first place when we just arrived, running and confused: JAL arranged another flight by which we can get home at midnight on the same day ?. Only when we recheck our tickets it appears that we have to wait 5 hours at KL and arrive at 10:00AM the next day. (The group that were left from the final flight was about 6 people). When we asked about our luggage, she said that our luggage is already transferred to the final destination and we don't have to worry about them  - should we not worry if the luggage arrive before us? Later, I checked with another girl at the counter, she said that our luggage are coming with us on this flight, and it is the airlines rule that the luggage must fly together with the passenger.

By then, she had already put all our luggage on the conveyor belt, and they all had left the counter, then asked us to pay 60,000 krw. None of us even had any carry-on baggage, and could have easily taken out our duffle bags to carry 1 measly kg each. We had no choice but to pay the fee, when she had multiple ways to handle the situation. When we boarded the plane, I saw everyone with 2-3 carry-ons each all stuffed together to look like 2. I was incredibly upset by the unfairness of our treatment. I tried to contact the airline and they asked us for more details of our flight, then ignored me. I point out that the tray table on one of our aisle seats was broken. They are a ''budget'' airline for a reason. Oh, other minor things, they didn't even offer us water, you had to ask for it.

"Jet Airways";2;"'''service is substandard'''";"8th February 2019";"VERDADERO";"London to Mumbai. It was my first time experiencing Jet Airways and I think it is appropriate to say I won’t be using them going forward.  The quality of service is substandard when comparing to other flight providers. The price was the same as other airlines but I chose to use this airline for the hours they were flying. I should have heeded the warning from relatives but knowing that I am not the first to recognise an issue in the services shows that the issue lies within Jet Airways. Their online check in system was ridiculous to say the very least. You’re allowed to check in up-to 48 hours before your flight but have to pay for your seat if you want to check in 12-48 hours before your flight? I’ve never heard of such a far fetched scheme. Of course by the time you wait for free check-in twelve hours before your flight, you can only have free seats in the most unorthodox seats so wave farewell to anyone you decided to travel with. Not to mention that you can only pick your meal and provide your emergency contact information if you check in online, so checking in at the airport means you are given what ever they have left in the back and only told this when you’re up in the air and if the situation where an emergency may rise you are screwed. The staff at the check in counters looked like this was the last place they wanted to be and they appear to have an allergy to smiling. I had to take 2 planes: 9.5 hours from London to Mumbai and then transfer to a 2.5 flight to Amritsar, that’s 12 hours in total. In this time they only gave one meal, one poor excuse of a meal where I couldn’t have more than 3 bites, and I usually enjoy flight meals. The second flight I had to pay for a coffee. Pressing the button to request services from the flight attendant worked in either two ways: waiting 15 minutes until they come, or the flight attendant arriving and pressing the button to cancel the call saying that they will assist you in a moment but surprise surprise, they keep away from until you have to get their attention again. On the first flight where I had to sit nearly 10 hours, I thought to ask for some alcohol to at least relax and make the most of the trip, only to be told that they don’t have anymore - this was 3 hours into the flight. I don’t even know what I paid for, no food no booze and no sense of the word service. The second flight also gave me the chance of witnessing others lack of being attended to. This poor couple had to ask 3 times for a pillow for their baby. They asked twice for some water, but repeatedly being forgotten about meant the only thing they could do to get through their flight was go to sleep, hopefully waking up to realise this flight journey was just a dream. Now I have been told that my return journey has been pushed up 3 hours, with no choice for an alternative flight. Not looking forward to it since I have to wake up 3 hours earlier than initially planned so I’ll have to skip my hotel breakfast only to wait for another 10 hour flight that serves one portion of gruel.";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"London to Mumbai";2019-01-02 00:00:00;30;20;10;40;30;10;30;"no"

In essence, if you can’t be bothered with the smallprints, you may find yourself completely ripped off. I booked returns from London to Ahmedabad via Mumbai, return. Flight out ok but basic with regards to service etc. However, I had to go through picking up luggage at Mumbai, picking up luggage and clearing customs (count a couple of hours) before re-issuing national boarding pass for follow on national flight to Ahmedabad (doesn’t work like most transfer flight arrangements, do it yourself is the motto). So far, so medium good. Now to the rip off part of the story. I wanted to change my return flight from Ahmedabad to London via Mumbai to directly flying out from Mumbai (as I was Pune three days before departure). So called them to let them know (as requested by terms and conditions) that I was cancelling the Ahmedabad to Mumbai leg of journey and the operator said all was fine and should check in at Mumbai directly. This seemed confirmed by email, inviting me to check in at Mumbai (and not Ahmedabad). At check in at Mumbai I was confronted with a >£300 penalty fare for ‘no-show’ at Ahmedabad. They maintained that if I wanted to get my flight back (none of this was mentioned on phone or email) I had to pay the penalty fare for the entire journey. So basically it was pay up or stay in Mumbai. Funnily, after being forced to pay the penalty fare, a stranded tourist asked for a quote on same flight and was offered a price of £190! So buying a new ticket was much cheaper than the penalty fare I just paid (not that the Jet Airways staff offered this alternative solution to me at the time, great customer care!). Since, I provided them with all requested information to reclaim my extra not justified costs. So far only got a nearly (English) incomprehensible drivel (quite comical) from customer relations with no detailed explanations.";;"Business";"Economy Class";"London to Ahmedabad via Mumbai";2018-01-12 00:00:00;20;30;20;40;40;30;10;"no"

On 12 December morning, I received a text message from Jet Airways that the flight 9W610 has been rescheduled due to operational reasons to leave Kolkata at 7:45PM and arrive Mumbai at 10:40PM. As with the rescheduling it was impossible to catch the international flight at 11:45PM, I approached Jet Airways to change my booking to an earlier flight.

They told ne it is Jet Airway’s policy to make the customer responsible if the flight is delayed by less than two hours even if the reason of the delay is on their part (in this case it was Operational Reasons). Later on, I came to know recently Jet Airways is in financial trouble. So, it may be an innovative business model on their part to generate extra money by rescheduling flights by just less than two hours so that they can squeeze extra money from some passengers.

Then having to get moved around to balance plane, being told he still might not be able to land again and might have to come back to Tenerife north again. Luckily after 2 more attempts to land he did. Unsure how everyone else were able land and he couldn’t? Maybe his ability wasn’t as high as the other pilots? Awful customer service with information provided on the flight and being on a plane for near on 11 hours isn’t great way to spend your first day on holiday when it should of been 5 hours max.

Upon arriving at Tenerife south airport at 8pm for our return flight home about an hour in we were told we were delayed until midnight when we were told we would be boarding shortly from gate C40. So travel to other side of airport, go through passport control, to sit there for another hour and a half then was told the flight was cancelled. No other information was gave to us for another 45 minutes, just had to stand there waiting. Then had to walk to other side of airport to be told we’ll be getting put up in a hotel for a night and our next flight would be 1pm the next day. Upon sitting for hours until Jet2 sorted out accommodation for everyone we eventually arrived there at about 3:30am. We arrived at a hotel that could only be compared to the Cecil hotel, absolutely shocking rooms. Would give the cleanliness a 1/10. Had to change rooms as there was a cockroach running about the room. Had no sleep whatsoever then our transfer came (which was also late) Got to the airport for 11am for our next flight at 1pm. Checked bags in, went through security, looked at departure board five minutes later, delayed until 10:40pm. You can imagine how upset and angry everyone was. Another day of sitting in the airport. After waiting all day we then got on a flight at 8:25pm and returned home a day later than expected. Can only say about Jet 2 staff that they are a shambles. Communication was absolutely terrible. Whilst we were standing waiting on information they just kept saying “see it as having an extra day on holiday? which I don’t understand as we’d been in an airport for two days. Tried to claim compensation yesterday and I got back that the flight was delayed due to “extraordinary circumstances?. Don’t really see how that’s my problem or my fault. Feel sorry for all the people travelling with children. There was kids trying to sleep on the floor of the airport whilst jet2 were no where to be seen.

The lack of compassion and understanding from the staff members was quite disgusting, I understand protocol is to be followed however it isn’t as if we were expecting a refund at such a last minute so I didn’t see our request as being so unreasonable to move the holiday to a later date and pay the difference and admin fee. I then called Jet2 back after speaking with my Travel Insurance to cancel the holiday - the staff member I spoke to to cancel the holiday was aware of terrible time and stress we are currently enduring and I made them aware of the reason for cancelling and our family dog requiring life saving treatment and he ended the call with a “I hope you have a fantastic day? !

When we came back at 5:30 pm there was no one from JetairFly who could help us. After 1 hour finally someone came and he told us there was another plane who would take us to Cancun. Because it was a new plane we had to get new boarding passes. It took them quite a while to do this. This was 8:15 pm. Unfortunately the boarding system was also broken so they had to manually process everyone. By 8:30 pm we were the first on the plane and after 1 hour we finally took off. The new plane didn't have entertainment but because we flew by night that was not a big issue. I know JetairFly couldn't do anything about the airplane being broken, but when you tell your passengers to be at the gate at 5:30 pm, there has to be at least 1 person available and that was not the case this time.

On the flight, the key issues include extremely hard and uncomfortable seats, very little to no legroom, no inflight entertainment, the worst food I have ever had the misfortune of eating, and an absolutely full plane. It is still a 6.5 hour flight, so some comfort would be welcomed! There isn't even a business class option or premium economy.

Flying with this company was the worst experience of my travel life. The ticket was unreasonably expensive and cost 1/5 of the total amount for the entire trip. Auckland to Rarotonga was already delayed for almost 2 hours without an answer as to why. I sat in seat 1A and the seat was reasonably comfortable. After take-off, the flight proceeded normally. The food served on board the plane was bad as I expected. The flight was turbulent, but the staff handled it very well. On the flight back, they informed us that 27 pieces of baggage were not on the plane. That we don't have to worry about our baggage. I checked in 2 pieces of luggage and both were lost. I dealt with the situation at the airport in Auckland, because I flew back to Vienna on January 10, 2023. One piece of my luggage was returned to me after 42 days  damaged and I had to pick it up at the Vienna airport. Everything was soaked and moldy as if it had been soaked in water for a long time. Communication with customer service is complicated and without real answers. In the e-mails, they claimed to have found the luggage and asked for the delivery address. I have not yet received compensation. Despite the increased expenses as we had to buy new winter clothes for the trip back. Not to mention damaged luggage. The second piece of lost luggage was not delivered to me and I still do not have an answer when it will be delivered to me.

Read on to understand why. We flew into Auckland Airport, New Zealand on 3.12.22 with the intention to cycle tour around this beautiful country. Unfortunately our hold boxes containing our bicycles and everything else except our hand luggage, did not arrive at the same time. We were left with no option but to hire a car to get to our prepaid accommodation some 60km away. For 4 days we rang and emailed Jetstar. On each occasion we were told that they were still trying to locate our luggage. We were promised on numerous occasions that someone would call us back to give us an update. Annoyingly no call was ever received. With our travel plans totally disrupted, out of sheer frustration, we drove back to Auckland airport to discuss the matter face to face with the lost/delayed baggage department. After queuing for an hour with our angry folk trying to locate their luggage, we finally got to see someone. Eventually, they actually found our boxes whilst we waited. There must of been at least another 6 bike boxes in the lost luggage hall along with literally hundreds of suitcases. Who knows how long we would have been waiting for Jetstar to advise us that they actually had our luggage at Auckland airport. Days possibly weeks we suspect. Ours, is sadly not an isolated incident. Since then, we have sent email after email trying to recover the unbudgeted car hire costs we were forced to spend due to Jetstar’s inabilities. Jetstar flatly refuse to refund us these costs and insist that they will only cover the costs of the emergency toothpaste and brush we had to purchase.

No food vouchers offered, you have to force them to do everything and therefore force you to become an annoying passenger for the unfortunate ground personell. Last but not least, our last flight was delayed by two hours and the only offered option instead of our actual transfer flight was to stay at the airport for 10 hours, again no offers of food or lounge without going to the counter and waiting in line for an hour. What took the crown was that our automatically rebooked flights and human rebooked flights were all still in the system with no tickets reissued. That meant that we were unable to check in, unable to reserve seats, unable to get the seats we payed for and altogether made it impossible for the lady at the counter to understand what was going on without calling KLM directly.

After having completed so many surveys for KLM where they wanted to know how valued and special I felt as a customer, now they seem not to care any longer at all about their customers. I used to be a flying blue gold member, almost reached platinum and now I am still a silver member. Despite this, the way KLM now treats me every time I fly with them is worse than the cheapest of the airlines. Their staff do not appear to know or understand the applicable benefits for each of their membership levels. It clearly states on the website that silver flying blue members have priority check-in, baggage drop-off and boarding. However, every single time I go to any of those lanes I am told extremely rudely that I am not allowed to use either of these services. Even when I show them the current KLM flying blue website / the KLM App that clearly states that silver members have those benefits, I am told that it no longer applies. In February 2023 KLM left us stranded in Tanzania for 24 hours due to allegedly security threats. However, when going to the official Dutch foreign ministry advice for travelling no alerts were provided for the area we were in. After I finally returned home, I filed a claim to KLM for compensation which was denied with no explanations. Then I filed a claim for reimbursement of expenses (namely 1 extra day at the hotel and 1 extra day at Schiphol long term parking) and I only received a refund for the hotel. I asked at least 25 times to KLM via all the channels they have (email, website, KLM customer service support at Schiphol airport, Messenger, flying blue phone number) why I didn’t receive a refund for the parking expenses. After 3 months I am still awaiting for a reply that will obviously never come! Incredibly rude, utterly stupid and I would expect much more from an airline such as KLM.

I transferred points so we could elevate our flying experience. We also booked her best friend with us separately. I booked all 3 in premium economy together from SFO to AMS. Upon check-in (24 hours prior), the system split all 3 of us up. I had to call customer service to fix the issue. However, they were unable to sit our friend with us. We were excited about our journey so decided to just go with it. On our return flight, we were yet again split up and also downgraded. I had to spend another 3 hours on the phone trying to find solutions. No customer service reps wanted to help. I had to find the solution myself and we were still unable to get our friend with us. I was told to do the reimbursement online for the downgrade. So I did and it was rejected. More phone calls to customer service. I asked for supervisors but was told the reps do not have supervisors. No managers to assist them. I was told it was rejected because I didn't submit proof. Is information not stored at KLM? I asked for the reps email so I can send proof. Apparently reps do not have company emails so I cant email the rep now. I submitted proof and was told I would get some points back. I was given 68k points for my troubles. 68k?! Can I even book a premium economy flight for 2 for that? During this process I have spent approximately 8 hours on the phone and been ''disconnected'' four times without a return call. It seems KLM just ignores the customer in hopes they go away. They put all the work on the customer rather than take charge. This has been the worst customer service I have ever seen.

Once again: a Business Class passenger, member of both private and corporate loyalty programs, gets their luggage lost by KLM and is advised to go look for it themselves. Fly KLM again? I don't think so. BTW, there were queues at that Lost Luggage desk, so... if you care for your property, see if there's another airline that can take you - and your luggage - to your destination.

The night before our departure, we received notice from KLM that we would not have business seats because of a change in aircraft. We went to the airport hours early to rectify this. As far as we could find out, we were the only two people on the flight who could not be accommodated in business class. Two 75-year olds! No amount of interceding could change this. They put us in Economy and offered a voucher for half the additional cost we had paid for business class, as though we would ever use this airline again. Four months later, hours and hours on KLM ''customer service,'' many emails to the WTravel Group and we have yet to get any money back. KLM, on its website, says that a ''downgrade'' will be compensated, according to the miles flown, by up to 2/3 the cost of the flight.

However, there is a minimum standard of respect for your customers and I believe the La Compagnie staff just does not get that. My flight last night was supposed to leave EWR at 7PM. After 3 hours of wait in this dirty lounge (with cheap wine, like dirt cheap stuff) they ended up cancelling the flight for a ''mechanical'' failure. The trouble here is that you kind of expect to be treated like a business class customers (your ticket says business class) but in fact you are not at all. We were offered to go to an airport hotel until they could figure something out, what we didn't know. I politely refuse the offer and went home instead. ''We will call you at 6am tomorrow and please be ready to go again''. All right, not that bad, its 11PM i am on my way home in a Uber, I'll leave tomorrow. Guess what, none of this happened. No email, no phone call on the B plan, silence.  I ended up call them, or being on hold for hours should I say. See the trouble with these little guys is that they really only have 2 planes, thats it. If one fails, you are done. This is the second time this is happening to me in a year. I am a regular on AF.

However, the flight was delayed due to unknown reasons, no reason was every given. The staff at the check-in were, I cannot find words in the English language to do their, utter, extraordinary, total incompetence justice. There were only two on the desks with queues stretching out for some distance. Yet there were many staff members chatting to each other, or on radios or mobile phones and when they felt like it interrupting the members on the desk and the people on the desk talking on their mobile phones, disappearing to a back office, at one point there was know body sitting at the desks, I could go on. I could hear people in the other queue shouting that they would miss their flights. When I finally got to the front desk I was informed that “don’t worry the flight is delayed 20 minutes you will not miss your flight? meaning the Cusco flight to Lima. I finally got the flight to Lima, only to be informed by the pilot mid air that the flight was an hour delayed. I arrived at Lima only to be informed that my connecting flight had long gone. I entered a very long queue called “missed departures? the one and only member of staff on the desk made the staff at Cusco look like members of MENSA and NASA!! That one person it appeared could not stick to one task, she continually let other members of staff interrupt her, disappeared, you get the picture etc etc entertained a small group of people who forming an unofficial queue, it was a total mess, I stood with other for over two hours, with no refreshments, no information, nothing. When it was my turn the lady said I could wait for another 24 hours and get the 20:05 KLM or she could put me on an Air Europa flight to Madrid then Amsterdam then Manchester. I said no I wanted to go to either Amsterdam, Manchester or Madrid, Amsterdam as that is what I had paid for. This sent her into confusion, with much tapping of the keyboard and phone calls both land line and mobile. Then she said “yes the flight goes to Madrid and then Manchester. I asked her to confirm this that it did not go to Amsterdam, no she said Madrid then Manchester, no Amsterdam. She then after many interruptions booked me a Hotel for 5 hours and a Taxi, she also gave me a code that I should show at the Air Europa check-in. I returned to Lima Airport went to the Air Europa check-in handed in my code. There was a few phone calls and then the lady tapped on a calculator and showed me a large number. I asked if that was the ticket number, no it the cost of a new ticket. The lady at the missed departure line the day before had only made a reservation and had not booked any flight tickets at all! So another trip to the other side of Lima airport to talk to another LAN Airlines member of staff. You guessed it many mobile calls, land line calls, tapping of keyboards etc etc. Then asked to wait for 5 minutes, I asked what was happening he could not tell me, and proceeded to deal other people. Then, after some time, he calls me back and tells me that the tickets are booked, Lima to Madrid, then Amsterdam and then Manchester. I could have screamed, but I just wanted to get out of there and so took the tickets. Little did I know that Air Europa is a very poor substitute for KLM.

The cabin in row 14 was extremely warm i.e. uncomfortable. When using the restrooms I noticed the rear of the plane was quite comfortable. I went to ask flight attendants if something could be done of if they could look into the temperature. They acted like it was a crazy request. A few hours later after my hands and feet were uncomfortably swollen a flight attendant stopped by to see if anyone had answered the call button. This I'd pressed about an hour before. This is lousy service. This flight attendant was marvellous. This new attendant however said that the pilot controls the cabin temperature and in fact it was quite warm in our area. She said she'd discuss the issue with the pilot. Half an hour later the temperature was beginning to come down and there was some airflow in the cabin.

I then pressed the button that calls for staff because I fly often and know that you can press it if you want something and then a flight attendant came who took my order and would come with it immediately. Then the female flight attendant came from earlier and scolded me for pushing the button and that it is forbidden and a big problem to press it and that I had already talked to her about the drink I wanted. I didn't know that you can't press the button and it says nowhere about it either, but I apologized for it and just wanted something to drink. They were already delayed with the flight and then they were unpleasant onboard and it was really unruly and poor customer service. This is the first and last time I fly with Laudamotion and I really do not recommend this airline to anyone. Really bad and worst airline due to staff. But want to point out that the pilot did an incredibly good job and was impressively good at landing that you barely noticed it. Jag flög igår med min fru och mina barn från skavsta till düsseldorf med Laudamotion OE195 och det hela började med att den var först 1h 30min försenad då flyget som skulle ankomma landade sent. Vi steg ombord och var redan trötta och irriterad över den långa väntetiden och det var sent på kvällen. Personalen på planet var otrevlig och taskiga redan från start mot alla och hade ingen respekt. När jag sedan satt på min plats och när planet började lyfta så ville jag sova en stund innan serveringen började. Jag ville sedan köpa något att dricka och frågade om det till flygvärdinnan men hon svarade otrevligt med att det var många som hade beställt samma dricka och att det kanske inte finns. Hon sedan struntade i att kolla om det fanns och fortsatte med sin reklam för dom andra produkter dom säljer onbord. Jag tryckte sedan på knappen som kallar på personal för jag flyger ofta och vet att man kan trycka på den om man vill ha något och då kom en flygvärd som tog min beställning och skulle komma med det strax. Då kom den kvinnliga flygvärdinnan från tidigare och skällde ut mig för jag tryckte på knappen och att det är förbjudet samt ett stort problem att man trycker på den och att jag redan hade pratat med henne om drickan jag ville ha. Jag visste inte att man inte får trycka på knappen och det står ingenstans om det heller men jag bad om ursäkt för det och ville bara ha något att dricka. Dom vart redan försenade med flyget och sen är dom otrevliga onbord och det var verkligen oproffsigt och dålig kundservice. Detta är första och sista gången jag flyger med Laudamotion och jag rekommenderar verkligen inte detta flygbolag till någon. Verkligen dåligt och sämsta flygbolaget pågrund av personalen. Men vill påpeka att piloten gjorde ett otroligt bra jobb och var imponerande duktig på att landa att man knappt märkte det.";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Skavsta to Düsseldorf";2019-01-12 00:00:00;20;10;10;10;;;10;"no"

There seemed to be no air conditioning and the temperature in the airplane had each of us sweating profusely with most travellers only getting relief from using safety cards to fan themselves. Towards the end of the short flight it did really seem that we were cooking in the aircraft. Relief was only felt when getting outside the back door to get some fresh cool air.

"LOT Polish Airlines";1;"LOT Polish Airlines customer review";"8th September 2022";"FALSO";"Tirana to Toronto via Warsaw. LOT is the worst company I have ever dealt with, here’s why: 1. I was planning my trip back to Ukraine from Tirana to see my parents, it takes me 40 minutes to get to the airport from the other city by taxi, which I paid 40€ for. Once the check in started and it was my turn, I was told, that they will NOT board me on the flight. Mind you, no emails were sent whatsoever. I was told to call LOT for further info, their office never answers, anytime you call you minimum will be the 45th in the queue. I had my whole route planned, my second flight from Warsaw was departing 2 hours later, my bus reservations made from Poland to Ukraine, one after another. As a compensation they gave me the worst hotel room possible, very dirty and old, and also I was called from an anonymous number and told I can pick up 250€ in their office, which I did. 2. I decided to ask about my trip with them for later on This month to Canada from Albania, I have a cat I’m taking with me, which I couldn’t register through their website, their form just doesn’t go through. It happened once before once I used their company, but I ended up just paying for my cat in their office on the day of the flight with absolutely no issue. I told them I wanted to register my cat right now (this is occurring 4 weeks before the flight, I purchased the ticket a month prior to the flight), which they told me they DONT HAVE ANY PLACES FOR ANIMALS ON BOARD ANYMORE. Despite me pleading and saying that they can take their compensation back but just let me take my cat because an extra 4 kg will not harm them, and just make an exception for me, because they completely destroyed my trip, it was pointless, and no other option was offered other than paying an extra of 600$ to upgrade to business class so I can take my cat (apparently there are places for animals there), they claimed they didn’t have any places for animals on flights till the very end of the month, and even first days of October, so no other option was available. After me saying that the form on their website doesn’t work so I couldn’t have possibly registered my cat, I was told that they have a claim section on their website I can go to… I was in total shock because so much was happening already with my trip being messed up and me having to rebook everything, (still haven’t gotten my refund for buses I canceled and had to buy new ones), and now they told me I can’t take my cat! I understand that the people working there are robots, because they deal with customers, but you have to be completely heartless if I’m saying I can’t leave my cat because there’s nobody in that country that I know and just crying because of how helpless and lost I felt. 3.I filed for a refund and landed money to buy another ticket from another company immediately, because the later it gets the more expensive are the tickets. ONE WEEK IN NO EMAIL was sent to me confirming they have received my claim, (and their website says you can’t file more than once, or they won’t look into your claim at all). I Was told that it’s not 100% that my ticket is refundable, depending on the type of the ticket I purchased, gladly it was the refundable one but still!!! How is it possible you have tickets that are non refundable if I want to return them almost a month before the flight??? It IS MY MONEY. And the amount was 600$+. I came down their office once again to ask about my refund and when I’ll be receiving it, they told me 60 days, SIXTY!!!!!!";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Tirana to Toronto via Warsaw";2022-01-09 00:00:00;10;10;10;10;10;10;10;"no"

The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ''reply'' but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage.

It is unacceptable that a refund would be confirmed and then not actually paid, particularly in the circumstance where I had booked another flight with Lufthansa in order to return from Munich following my original flight cancellation. I have now in effect paid twice for my family to fly home. What makes this all the more frustrating, is that despite completing numerous “Customer Feedback forms? on the Lufthansa website, no one is responding to my queries and if any response is received it is an automated one. I have attempted three times to speak with a customer services representative and on every occasion they state that the “refunds department? is dealing with the request.

Naturally I woke up and headed straight to the airport to find out my flight had been cancelled and I had to head back into the city. A few hours notice that your flight has been cancelled and a 3am phone call is not acceptable in the slightest. I then got to airport and had a small gym bag filled with a few changes of clothes and a small work laptop. I was charged $90 dollars to bring this small bag onto the flight an absolutely outrageous price. When I brought up my displeasure at the price and the prior service, I was told to call the airline to complain, this was coming from someone who works in customer service for the airline, and I was argued with.

This is a rare circumstance and you are more likely to lose money and gain a headache. I flew, or attempted to fly, from Calgary to St. John’s last week via Toronto. We started off with delays. Staff on the flight are mostly new and young. While they’re courteous enough they are also unprofessional (taking selfies with each other throughout the flight, served water to each other prior to serving customers). We got all the way to above St. John’s and were told our flight could not land in St. John’s due to heavy fog therefore we were taken back to Toronto. Of note, many flights from other (more reputable) airlines landed just fine around the same time. It’s also questionable why they took us back to Toronto when they have closer gates to land at, I assume this was due to not wanting their aircraft out of commission for other flights, easier to inconvenience us. We were told a gate agent would be waiting when we got back to advise us of hotel accommodations and food voucher arrangements. There was one agent waiting who had no info. She insisted we had all been sent emails with the info, despite us repeatedly stating we had not. When Lynx does not have flights scheduled they do not have staff in the airport therefore there was no one to assist us with anything. Our bags took 2 hours to get back off the plane, with mass confusion as to which carousel they would even come to. No emails ever came (I was on a return flight the following week with passengers on this flight who confirmed they too received nothing). Lynx made no attempts to contact us to get us home, offer to rebook flights, etc. We spent hours and hours on hold and on phone/support chat trying to get assistance. They could not fly us out until 6 days later which was too late for my travel partner so her whole trip was ruined. I flew out via Air Canada instead at my own expense but lost 3 days of the trips included money lost on car rental and accommodations. Customer service insisted their records show email notifications were sent out (though I magically got all emails with my itineraries and flight delay notifications no problem). I’m now back home and have submitted a complaint and request for reimbursement but I’m not hopeful as emails I sent while in the midst of needing help in Toronto have yet to be responded to. Don’t do it. The “cheap? fares will cost you more money once things inevitably go wrong and there is not even a baseline level of customer support to help you once they do.

Both my fiance and I were on our way to Las Vegs to be married flying out on the 1st June at 8 am. Our travel saga started when the aircraft engines started smoking just before take off and we had to make our way back to exit tunnel at YYC Airport. We then waited on the aircraft for two hours while they tested all engines. After waiting for over 2 hours we were told we must disembark and continue to terminal 73A while they get a new aircraft. Finally, after another three hours we embarked on another Lynx Aircraft and started our journey to Las Vegas. This was not the pinnacle of the story because after our wedding in Las Vegas our return flight was set for 11.30am on the 6th June Las Vegas to Calgary. The standard procedure stated on Lynx Air Web site is a 72hr window check in before departure which I attempted to with no prevail. The morning of my flight 6th June, both my wife and I had little sleep knowing we cannot confirm our flight.

They offered me a $50 voucher, which the agent said that was going to be applied to my total amount. However, when I finally arrived home and had some time to see my bank statements, I noticed they charged me the full amount (without the discount applied) and promptly contacted them to have that fixed. They said that could not do anything other than give me another $50 voucher. I told them that that was absurd and it doesnt make sense to me as will never fly with lynx again.

We were shuffled around by customer service, left on hold, then hung up on. Because we couldn't speak to anyone to have it taken care of, we went to the airport early to make sure we did not run into any problems again. We booked our bassinet and the extra leg room seats.

When asked about it, the ground staff took over 2 30 minutes to locate some rule stating that alcohol was considered a ''dangerous product''. So was ''perfume'', according to the same rulebook (we checked), but no one was deprived of their perfume before flying (I even got to keep my cologne). It becomes even stranger when you consider that the same alcohol bottle had made the journey first from Bali to Jakarta, then from Jakarta to Belitung - and only then was considered to be a ''danger'' somehow - and this was cabin luggage from start to end. My friends' alcohol bottles were permitted the whole way to and back from Bali, but not mine. Subsequent queries to the airline went unanswered, despite several follow ups (this is two weeks ago, and the only response I got was about my reservation number, then nothing ). When asked about whether it was permitted to bring alcohol on flights, or how my bottle was more dangerous than a perfume bottle (or in any way dangerous, as people with common sense would be prone to ask), or how a bottle of alcohol carried by a foreigner was a ''dangerous'' item but a bottle of alcohol carried by an Indonesian wasn't, I was met with a deafening silence.

After the trip, I sent the request through their e-mail system. Having waited for a week without any contact back, I decided to contact the call center. The response received was that the consideration was in the process (for god sake, I am not applying for job, just a receipt,, what exactly do you need to consider). Then a week later and still no contact from Nok air, I decided to call them again. This time they said they will follow the case and contact back. I did specifically ask them to contact me back today because I got tired of the chasing. Kindly enough, Nok Air contacted me back on that day, informing that my information for issuing tax invoice was insufficient (took them two weeks to realize that). Then, I explained that what I need is just a document from the airline, not necessarily tax invoice, just a receipt is fine. Then, I was told that a receipt cannot be issued after the travel.

As the flights for the same time next year had been made available online through travel agents and direct on Omanair.com I explained I would like to undertake the rescheduling now so that I could secure my reschedule and avoid paying a higher cost when there was less availability. The airline explained that they would not allow me to reschedule my flights until Muscat Airport was fully reopened. Yet they would allow new passengers to book flights via travel agents and direct on their website. I explained to customer services that this was unfair and meant that I may not be able to take them up on the reschedule they have offered me and would have to pay an inflated price if availability was later limited. They advised that it was their rule. They have continued to offer ever more frequent “special flights? but without committing to allowing people to reschedule their previously cancelled flights.  Having been a frequent user of Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, and with this being my first experience of Oman Air I cannot recommend them in anyway.

It left us with barely 10 minutes to shop before rushing onto the aircraft which then spent over an hour on the ground in Turkey.

On April 2, 2016, we were called to board the plane, and at that moment, we were given the news the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. The information we received was chaotic. The female gate agent did not use the PA system and the message was in only one language. People could not hear details which raised the anxiety level within the group. We were led throughout the airport to clear customs, and pick up our checked luggage. We were finally sent to another counter on the other side of the terminal to deal with hotel and voucher procedures. Many followed blindly. We were told countless times to check our email to receive rebooking information from BA. It never arrived. I finally was able to get the gate agent to listen to me when I told her I called BA and they claimed the flight wasn't cancelled, thus the reason why none of us received a rebooking email. The gate agent was unaware that BA was oblivious. The BA agent on the phone told me that our flight was not cancelled. When I explained I cleared customs and currently have my checked in luggage returned and in my hands, she told me she couldn't help me because their screens did not show a cancellation. This was told to me after almost an hour had passed after we heard about the cancellation. Surreal. We were lucky. We were 2 out of 7 allowed to make the 13:40 flight out the next day. All of those folks booked for the same time the day following - cancelled again. I can't even imagine suffering a cancellation two times in a row. Unfortunately, this seems to be happening more than it should. There doesn't seem to be much support going out to this airline and it's unfortunate. In addition to this event, the seats in biz bed and premium economy are very worn and in some cases, the seats are not properly maintained and do not work. It's sad because this airline has such potential. I felt bad for the gate agents who attempted to handle the situation as best as they could. The gentleman (gate agent) was calm, cool and helpful, but it was clear they were all winging it with no support. We can no longer fly Openskies. We can't afford to gamble on when we might reach our destinations.

Unfortunately I had to book my return flight for this summer in November when my schedule was still a bit up in the air. About 3 weeks ago however I finalized my schedule and saw to my dismay that I would need to change my ticket by about two months. I was bracing myself for a ticket change fee - but was shocked to find out that in order to change my ticket (giving them months notice) I will need to pay $450 in addition to about $150 extra for increased gas prices - that's $600 extra for a flight change with months notice! I emailed and called and spoke with many people - all said that same thing - that's policy no way around it. Now I don't expect a big cooperation to just change their policy for me but I do expect some sort of help or at least a little sympathy when I pay thousands of dollars for a ticket. The lack of care or sympathy from those I spoke and emailed with astonished me! Not only did they not give me a break at all but they didn't even put out the effort to seem sorry for my circumstances. Perhaps most people who use this airline are wealthy but I am not. I used them this year as a special treat and now I am absolutely paying for it. As of today I can buy a round trip ticket with British Airways from Paris to NY for less than $600.

"Peruvian Airlines";1;"'''Peruvian Airlines are appalling'''";"19th April 2017";"FALSO";"'  Cuzco to Lima. Peruvian Airlines are appalling. First, my flight from Cuzco to Lima was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting Copa/United flight in Lima to New York City. I was aware this was going to happen, so enquired in Cuzco itself about being put on another flight, but that didn't happen. The Peruvian staff put me on the delayed flight anyway, saying that there were 20 other people with the same connecting flight as me, and that ''Copa might wait'' (Copa did no such thing). When I get to Lima at 1pm, it takes me over an hour at the counter to wait for a staffer to replace the Lima-NYC flight I missed. Copa/United didn't have flights before 2am the next day, so I figured Peruvian would do better at replacing my ticket on another airline, than I would replacing it myself through United. Instead, the woman handling my case comes back after an hour and sends me off to a hotel to wait for a call at 9pm to confirm my flying out with Copa at 2am on the same flight I had enquired with United about.  Come 9pm, nothing happens. I call the number she gave me and received someone on the other line telling me to ''wait for their call''. I call back again at 11pm, and they said that I will likely only fly out the next day in the afternoon and would confirm at 9am. Call them at 9am, they said they were still waiting for a confirmation from United and would get one by 2pm. By 11am I had had enough and contacted United myself and begged them to let me replace my missed flight with no charge. I got a flight out for 10:30pm that night. Peruvian still hadn't contacted me by 8pm when I checked out of the hotel. This was yesterday, for me and I am pretty sure Peruvian would have happily let me fester in that hotel room for a week while they do god knows what with their time. Bottom line is, this is an airline to be avoided at all costs. They are so incompetent that you are very likely to encounter a delay or lost luggage.

Not only that, some of the passengers had their flights changed from noon, to 2, to 3, to 5. Only to be told in the end that they wouldn't have a flight out of Cusco that day.

"Peruvian Airlines";1;"'''never fly Peruvian Airlines again'''";"7th October 2015";"FALSO";"'4 hours late, horrible customer service!  We had a flight from Cusco to Lima with Peruvian Airlines. The agents were disorganized and never bothered to make announcements about what was going on as the departure time came and went. About 1.5 hours after the departure the agents disappeared (without providing any answers) and we had no choice but to leave the secured area and go to the ticket counter to find out what was going on. There we eventually found out that our plane was experiencing mechanical problems and the flight would most likely be leaving about 4 hours late. When we eventually arrived in Lima there was no one there to help the 20 or so passengers who had missed connections. We made our way to the ticket counter where the agent there insisted that she had to take all of our passports into the back room in order to look up our missed flights. She and one other agent would appear from time to time and give us scant answers and then dodge into the back room while the increasingly disparate group barraged them with more questions. We were stuck in the ticketing area for another 4 hours with no access to bathrooms, food, water, wireless or anywhere to sit as all of that was on the other side of the security check. Eventually the agent came out and explained (in Spanish only and disregarding the 75% of us who did not speak Spanish, though we had spoken with her in English earlier) that they were sending us all to a hotel for the night and would try to find us flights to our final destinations and let us know later. At the hotel we asked a waiter and he said that there were people at the hotel almost every day whose travel plans had been waylaid by Peruvian Airlines. We eventually got a note from the hotel reception that the airline had arranged a flight to Miami the next morning. However our final destination was Charlotte. We tried the customer service number but got no answer and we ended up booking a flight from Miami to Charlotte for $950 at our own expense. While leaving the hotel that morning we spoke with a teenage girl traveling alone who had been on our flight. She was trying to get home to the UK and had not received any word from the airline and was desperately trying to get information. Several of the other passengers from our flight were in the same situation. Back at the airport we tried to talk to a Peruvian Airlines agent about the flight to Charlotte and apparently of all of the agents milling around the place the only one who could be bothered to talk to us was a very angry manager who did not speak a word of english. In between yelling at other employees and nearly yelling at us we managed to get the name and email of a customer service person to contact. Once we arrived home I emailed the customer service agent and sent her all of our relevant flight information. A few days later I received an email thanking me for my understanding that flight delays happen and the importance they place on safety which I read as ''Get Lost!''. That doesn't hold water as their delay was because of their own poor plane maintenance and not a weather related incident so I hold them 100% responsible for our missed connections.

"Philippine Airlines";1;"'''experience was an absolute nightmare'''";"18th June 2023";"FALSO";"Our plan was to embark on a family holiday, traveling from Melbourne to Tokyo. We had flights booked from Melbourne to Tokyo (Haneda) with a three- and half-hour layover in Manila, and our hotels were all set and paid for. 1- The airline made a change to our Manila to Haneda flight, which initially didn't seem like a big deal as we still had enough time to catch our connecting flight. 2- Then, to our dismay, the airline further altered our first flight from 8:00 am to 11:00 am, causing considerable stress. It only allowed us a mere hour for the layover, which seemed quite challenging but potentially doable. 3- To our dismay, 48 hours prior to departure, they rescheduled once again, pushing our first flight from 11:00 am to 6:30 pm. This change meant we would miss our second flight entirely. I had to spend a frustrating three hours on the phone with PAL (Philippine Airlines) to reroute our journey. 4- Eventually, we agreed to a new route: Melbourne to Denpasar (operated by Qantas), Denpasar to Manila, and Manila to Tokyo. However, this decision was made a mere 48 hours before our scheduled departure. Despite the frustration, we proceeded with the check-in process for the Melbourne to Denpasar leg and prepared to leave. 5- Merely 16 hours before our flight, they changed the Denpasar to Manila departure time from 1:00 am to 6:00 am. This alteration left us unable to catch our third flight. The constant changes were causing immense frustration, especially with such short notice. 6- I had to endure yet another four-hour call with PAL's customer service to sort out the situation. They rescheduled our flights once more: Melbourne to Sydney (operated by Qantas), Sydney to Manila, and Manila to Haneda. This final change occurred less than 10 hours before our scheduled departure. 7- To compound the issue, PAL failed to issue our tickets despite confirming the new arrangement. They also neglected to call back as promised. Upon arriving at the airport to catch our Qantas flight from Melbourne to Sydney, we discovered that the tickets couldn't be issued because we had already checked in for the Melbourne to Denpasar flight. It was nearly impossible to locate PAL personnel at the Sydney airport, even with the assistance of Qantas staff. Frustrated and exhausted, we had no choice but to return home from the airport. 8- Thankfully, I received a call from a helpful Qantas representative while I was struggling to reach PAL again from home. She informed me that she had followed up with PAL in Sydney and arranged for a direct Qantas flight from Melbourne to Haneda. Finally, after a day of turmoil, we were able to board the plane. This entire experience was an absolute nightmare! The lack of management and poor customer service were beyond appalling. I'm baffled as to how they maintain a four-star airline rating.

I have had cases where I tried to book the flight online, credit card rejected, I call, the first person finds the reservation and confirms everything, then I get transferred to another person who has to confirm everything again, then takes my credit card info and processes it, then transferred to a 3rd person who has to confirm everything again and does the seat assignments. On any other airline you can do this online in 10 minutes or less, no problem. Maybe the extra customer service expense is part of why they're in bankruptcy. Bottom line, flights are OK, booking a flight is painful, and the only reason we fly PAL is they are the only airline with direct flights from LA to Manila. If you plan to fly PAL, plan on the time the time you save by flying direct to be wasted on the phone.

"Phuket Air";2;"Phuket Air customer review";"20th April 2005";"FALSO";"We flew with Phuket Air in January but have only just found this site. We must agree with all comments made about this airline. Our outward flight scheduled for 2.00 pm on 18 January was delayed until 7.00 am on 19 January. The aircraft was very cold for the whole journey lots of people sitting with blankets around them. The cabin crew were trying to keep the toilets clean but were not very effective. The in flight service was not of a good standard and we were left for many hours with no food at all. On asking about this we were given a tuna roll. Our return journey which should have left of 29 January at 11.50 pm was delayed until 12.45 pm on the following day. Before we left Sharjah after refuelling the engines on the right hand side of the aircraft were under observation on take off and periodically throughout the rest of the journey. We found this rather worrying more so now after the events of the last few weeks. Our travel insurance company rejected our claim for the return delay because the wording of the airline's letter stated the reason for the delay was 'aircraft rotation' and this is not covered under our policy. We arrived back at Gatwick at 8.30 pm on Sunday and were unable to use our return rail ticket and our son had to make a 400 mile round trip to collect us. We were left considerably out of pocket. We feel that the comments in the press from the airline representative over the fuel spillage incident last week patronising and indifferent to the very real fears of the passengers concerned. Phuket Air pulling out of Great Britain is the best news for travellers to Thailand. The flight problems left us with bad memories of an otherwise very enjoyable holiday.";;;;;;;;;;;;;"no"

"Phuket Air";1;"Phuket Air customer review";"21st February 2005";"FALSO";"Myself and my partner flew Phuket Air to BKK in Oct 04. The flight over was ok the plane was an old KLM jumbo which was tatty but comfortable. I agree with the comments about the cabin crew not being able to handle drunken louts. On the flight out there were a group of middle age men who were served alcoholic drinks from the time of serving to just prior to landing. Although they didn't cause any trouble I was very surprised that the cabin crew continued to serve them over a period of 11 hours. Our return flight was a bit of a nightmare. Having spent 6 hours waiting in Bangkok airport we boarded the plane at midnight. Our take off time came and went 40 minutes passed and we were told nothing. Then the captain said we would be taking off in 10 minutes (no apology). This came and went then another announcement there was a problem loading the luggage and we would be taking off in 10 minutes. Again this came and went. One and a half hours passed before we finally started to move. This KLM jumbo was really in bad shape and was much worse than the plane on the flight over it was dirty my table was broken and we generally didn’t feel that happy flying in it. As the plane turned the corner and revved the engine to join the runway there was the most horrendous smell of burning. We were sitting at the front end of the plane near to the kitchen in the nose cone. As the plane started to go down the runway the smell got much worse. All the cabin crew were up running about looking in all of the ovens trying to find the source of this smell. They all looked terrified which is pretty off putting to the passengers in the first place! The plane continued down the runway with the smell getting worse all the time. Even as the plane was taking off the crew continued to look for the problem. My partner and I were terrified as too seemed those people sitting around us. One lady even got us and asked the crew what was going on. They didn’t really tell her. The plane climbed very slowly with this smell still present. Whilst we were still climbing the captain came out and sniffed about with all the cabin crew flapping around him then the co-pilot came out and done the same. I think everyone on the flight feared the worst. We honestly thought we were going to be blown out of the sky. About an hour later the smell went away but we couldn’t settle after the adrenaline rush of panic. We also stopped in Sharjah which was awful as the air conditioning was switched off and we were delayed here too. We weren’t given any drinks were told not to use the toilet and weren’t allowed off the plane. Our journey home took us over 36 hours which marred the end of our holiday. I was most upset by the lack of information provided by the crew. We were not told about the burning problem or the cause of it or reassured about it there were no apologies at all. I would never fly Phuket air again nor recommend it. I am surprised that the BAA allows them to provide a long haul service from the UK.";;;;;;;;;;;;;"no"

"PLAY";2;"'''most miserable experience of my life'''";"20th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"'  Flying with Play was the most miserable experience of my life. The booking was easy, as was the check in. There were no delays and everything went smoothly. There is a massive issue however with the fact that they don't have a phone number. Never deal with a company that can't be contacted by phone. If anything goes wrong, you're on your own. While everything outside the craft was fine, inside the plane is a different story altogether. Firstly, getting seated was an absolute farce. The lack of organisation by the cabin crew seemed to rub off on the passengers. Several people switched seats, meaning some found another person sat in their seat. I've never seen this before on such a scale and I can therefore only attribute it to the fact that the cabin crew were not checking boarding passes or directing anyone. Getting seated took longer than I've ever seen on an aircraft and at no time were the crew trying to speed things along. The plane started taxiing with passengers still stood up. The main issue with the flight was the seats. I have never seen this many rows on this type of aircraft. There is no way on earth these things should be in the air for more than an hour. I am 5ft6 and I had so little leg room that I could not physically reach down to pull my bag up. If you are 6ft+ you realistically cannot fly this airline.  As if this could not be any worse, the seats recline. Yes. They recline. The room in front of me was reduced to level where I could not put my tray table down. It was 6 hours of absolute torture. Some passengers spent the entire flight stood in the aisle as they could not sit for that long. Everything on this flight is paid for separately. Fine. It's a budget airline. I get it. But water? Surely this is a basic human necessity. It was 3 Euros for the smallest bottle of water I've ever seen in my life. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Not only is it torture but it makes no financial sense. After adding in the extra legroom seat costs (you will need it), water and food, you are likely to be saving little to nothing. Take a real airline. You'll thank me. I'm sure Play will reply with their ''hi thanks we're a budget airline as such'' spiel, but it's not good enough. These planes should not exist. And if they do they should be flying one hour domestic, not transatlantic.'";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Washington to Athens via Keflavik";2023-01-07 00:00:00;10;20;10;10;10;10;10;"no"

However, all passengers were told to get our baggage back only at KEF, and we would make our connecting flights once at KEF. 10 minutes before landing, we were informed that all connecting flights had departed. Upon landing at the airport, not a single representative was available to speak to passengers. Half got emails with hotel accommodations/buses. I did not receive a single communication from Play. Not one message. I did not have a hotel room or ride from the airport. I could not contact anyone as the customer service was 'overwhelmed.' Passengers from the flight were wandering around the airport with nowhere to go. Many passengers went to hotels which were already overbooked. I ran out of my medication and was in physical pain for over 24 hours as I was already on my last additional dosage. I could not contact a single person and could not afford to get a different flight or hotel or accommodations, as I am still negative on my credit card bill. This entire issue could have been preventable if we were not A) told we would make our connections (despite an email saying we 'may' miss our flight, B) we were told we could only get our bags once at KEF (half the bags did not even show up) C) received some sort of direction or accommodation (I received not a single message.)

Lots of people had to fly to East Midlands the next afternoon and then make their own way to Stansted. This isn’t ideal but these things happen and at this point I wasn’t too annoyed with Primera Air. However, upon returning I have emailed my refund claim as asked and have had no reply. I have tried to phone them and their refund department do not have a phone number. The lady in customer services told me that they get thousands of claims a day so I shouldn’t expect a reply soon.

It was for myself, my husband and 4 children under the age of 10. For some reason, whilst booking, there was no option to select a child’s airfare. It was basically impossible to contact Qantas. I called and was on hold for over an hour and then got hung up on and another time was told by a recorded message to call back later and was disconnected. We needed to book our tickets so I booked them and continued to try contacting Qantas. Eventually, after being on hold for almost 2 hours I got through to someone. I explained the situation to them and they changed the booking to show that this was for 4 children. There was a difference in price so they said I would be refunded the difference. It could take up to 6 weeks for the money to go into my account so just wait. All seemed well. Our trip took place about 4 weeks later. I wasn’t all that impressed with Qantas when we flew but that’s another complaint. The 6 weeks came and went and I did not receive my refund. Once again I went through the process of calling Qantas and eventually got through to them. They said that because we had already flown we were not entitled to a refund. However, I had already been told we would get the refund before our trip so I didn’t understand how this was a problem. I was told to register a written complaint, which I did. Months later I still did not have an answer, so contacted them through email complaints department again. A few month later I received an email saying they were working on my claim. This went back and forth for a while. 2 weeks ago (well over a year since the original claim) I was told they regret my experience but they will not refund my money. They gave me some frequent flyer points which I don’t want because I will never fly with Qantas again. I truly believe they are in the wrong here. I was told I would get a refund and then the story changed after it was impossible for me to get the refund. This comes to like $400, which is a lot of money to me. Also, just as a general thing. We have flown with a few other airlines since then (we are doing humanitarian aid-type work in Thailand -which is why we were flying when Covid was still an issue) and every other airline has been just as good, if not better, than Qantas -including the cheaper ones. This goes for domestic and international so I would advise anyone to not fly with Qantas, even if they have a good deal. They are not any better than anyone else and if you have an issue it’s near impossible to work out. We don’t get paid for the work we do so any money we have is very needed.

Recently I have decided to give up the choice in favour for this airline for good. First and major issue is there online booking service. Even if you have booked a flight online and you cc was charged it does not mean you are done. Often flights are being cancelled. Customer service do not even bother to inform the passengers about the changes in advance they just rebook you for another flight on another date (that happens!) and then refuse to make a full refund if you decide to completely cancel your itinerary due to the fact they have cancelled the flight on exact date you needed. To reach their head office in St Petersburg by phone is a nearly impossible mission since it is permanently busy. Reaching customer support toll free number is useless since they will anyway send you out for a personal visit to their office. As you can imagine it is very handful for business travellers. Visit to the office is a guaranteed 2 hours waiting in a queue. A typical Russian service for a not so cheap price after all. They do not have to care about customers satisfaction since they will anyway hold up to 60% of the market. There are basically only two sufficient airlines in Russia - Rossiya and Aeroflot. Both state owned and both with beyond bad approach to customers. Unfortunately no other choice. Its a shame that a huge country like Russia with distances of up to 10000 km from Central to Far East destinations can not offer its citizens an airline we could be proud of.

We would appreciate if the airline could send us an advanced notification about the delay but NOT upon check in. We have arrived in Melbourne airport by 1520HR. Having the young children to wait at the airport for 7 hours till departing time 2230HR, without any assistance extended was not a good experience. Making matter worse, we were declined our request for a simple meal arrangement. This was not a very considerate and responsible gesture – as you can tell the delayed flight hour had passed the dinner time and we didn’t request for anything unreasonable. Poor arrangement on Connecting flight: We repeatedly express our concern of how this delay would impact our connecting flight,  ground staff reassured us that the delay will not affect the connecting flight to Kota Kinabalu. She affirmed that the flight will definitely wait for my family to connect to Kota Kinabalu as many passengers were transiting as well. It was obvious enough, from frequent traveling experience, having 30mins time to transit was quite impossible but we were once again reassured that we could make it. As expected, my family missed the connecting flight. My family was stranded and had to wait for the next available connecting flight to Kota Kinabalu at 2330HR on 11/12/2019 (vs original flight at 0030HR on 11/12/2019). As a result of above delay, the connecting flight from Kota Kinabalu to Kuching were forfeited, costing us extra expenses to purchase a new flight ticket.  When venting our frustration with Brunei Airline ground staff, the lady tried to reassure us that they will try to help to get a reasonable reimbursement and even attempt to negotiate with Malindo air to reschedule a connecting flight from Kota Kinabalu to Kuching. My family were then quickly shoved onto a bus full of other waiting passenger to a complimentary hotel and asked to wait for the update but no phone calls or follow up message received. When we called up the next day, the airline staffs denied any arrangement or promise being made, and deterred all responsibilities. No apologies made. We were feeling helpless. The original trip was supposed to take only 1 day to reach the final destination but the whole journey was prolonged to 2 days in the end.

I find the lack of alcohol on the planes and at the airport in Brunei quite refreshing, so this wasn't a concern for me. Seats on the 787 overnight flight to Melbourne were comfortable, even for a taller person, made better by the fact that the plane was only around half full, and the fact that the very considerate person in front of me never reclined her seat. I have never travelled on a full 787, so cannot comment on how comfortable the 9 across format would be on a full plane. My special meal was very nicely prepared, and the crew were warm and welcoming, doing water/juice runs, as well as a snack run (sweet or savoury) towards the end of the flight. I spent most of the nights watching movies from a reasonable selection of US and foreign language films.

(This is a problem because I have an important appointment to get too upon arrival). I asked the airline if the change was real because I had not received any emails confirming this change, what’s more they are saying the change is real and I will be stuck at my layover for 48 hours! My flight is tomorrow December 9 2022 and because of this change it will take me 4 days to get home. That’s a good chunk of my trip gone! I have been trying to contact the airline for the past few days, losing out on sleep trying to call them in their time zone during business hours. I am very frustrated because management will not help me and frankly do not care. I can clearly see there are flights to Zimbabwe on the day I was supposed to arrive at my destination. I am usually not one to write bad reviews but I want to put this out there to warn people not to gamble their travel plans on this airline. No one will accommodate you. You are on your own! I am never booking them again and will advise anyone considering them to support other airlines that will treat you like a human being in the very least.";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Doha to Harare via Kigali";2022-01-12 00:00:00;10;10;10;10;10;10;10;"no"

Upon arrival at Kilimanjaro, Tanzania i was informed that my luggage had not arrived and was left in South Africa and that i should find a way to go back to the airport the next day at night at 20h00 to collect my bag. The first problem with this is that they said the system was showing that i had checked in only one piece of luggage whereas i had checked in 2 pieces. On 24th i called to confirm before heading to the airport and was told that they located both bags but one of my bagts was sent to Nigeria and the other was in South Africa. Everyday they say my bags will be sent to my final destination on the next day but this does not happen. Neither do the staff seem to care about rectifying their negligence. It is the 27th tomorrow and i still have not received my bags, i had to cancel Christmas plans and spend Christmas without my belongings or presents for family and friends.

After RW assured us that they have fixed our tickets, they again made changes to our returning flight from Kigali to Addis without informing us. We purchased a direct flight from Kigali to Addis departing at 16:20 and without informing us prior, they changed the flight to 15:15 (one hour earlier) with a stop in Bujumbura. When we arrived at the Kigali airport, Rwanda airline representatives were not transparent with us about the stop in Bujumbura and the change of the flight times. When we wanted to receive some answers about the flight time changes and the sudden stop in Bujumbura the airport staff became rude and tried blaming us for this situation (this discussion took place at 15:09 - and they seriously wanted us to proceed through security and immigration) when the departure time was 15:15. When I asked them if the aircraft is still there and if it will wait for us, they did not give me an answer. Hence we were not able to board the flight because of their failure to inform us about the flight cancellation and rescheduling - incredibly enough they did not want to take responsibility and in all seriousness told us that we had to purchase a new ticket for $900 per person! After holding us at the airport for 9 hours without eating and drinking we spoke with airport security who finally decided that the airline was in the wrong and pressured the Rwandair staff to put us on a new flight (which was their responsibility all along). Rwanda Air is incredibly incompetent and unprofessional in providing customer support and service and have absolutely no training in how to treat their customers. Throughout our nine horrific hours at the airport, we were harassed by Rwandair staff - and called ''liars who wanted to miss our flight'' by the head of Customer Relations himself. They put us into an incredibly bad situation and took no responsibility until they were forced to by airport security. In addition they lost our luggage (it never left Mumbai and it is nowhere to be found), which still has not arrived in Addis.

We both ending up missing a day of work, since we were placed on stand-by the following day and had to pay out of pocket for a hotel room in Boston that SATA Airlines refused to pay.  After reading other reviews, I now see that this airline does not care about customer service and since they do not accept responsibility for their company's repeated flight delays and customer's out of pocket expenses caused by them, they will eventually go out of business or be bought out by another company.

We landed in the Azores on time and instead of going through the transit line like the people going to Lisbon, the connecting flight to Porto had to go through immigration and customs (even though I had a boarding pass for my next flight and the flight was made all on one booking), out to the check in area and back through security, only to walk directly back past the transit door on the way to my gate. My next flight to Porto was delayed two hours because the plane was late coming in from Toronto, but delays are expected so that didn't really bother me. My plane going to Porto was a newer plane with large, leather seats and lots of space in the overhead bins. If only that was my plane from Boston I might have gotten some sleep. The flight was smooth and the flight attendants on both flights were nice and helpful. The food was fine, nothing special but not bad. Overall, it wasn't the worst travel experience but not the best.

In fact they cancelled all our onward flights and did not make any attempt to help us get on our original flights. Instead they made us purchase new flights at a very significant cost.

We were due to fly from JFK to Delhi, connecting through Jeddah, on December 20th. Saudi proactively cancelled our flights from Jeddah to Delhi with no heads up. Pandemic and preemptive travel closures, sure. We had to call the customer service department multiple times just to cancel our full itinerary. They kept giving us the run around - telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line (more on this), or to email them. Finally, after no success on those fronts, they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. They claim the customer service phone department - where you can talk to humans - is completely disconnected from refunds processing - and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email. The WhatsApp support is the laziest, most lackadaisical responsiveness I've ever seen. They claim 24/7 support but regularly take 6-10 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply (usually with 1 word or 1 line), if you don't reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. - I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request for a flight they cancelled. Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp, the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status.

Then there was the transit at Singapore airport which was okay. Singapore to Bangkok was delayed by about 1 hour on departure when everybody was sitting on the plane and waiting without information. Because you cannot use your earphones before taking off and landing , as it would endanger your security if you cannot hear what the pilot would have to say, at least was the reply when I questioned their policy. They also have you straighten the seats and there again remove your earphones 15 minutes before landing.  This was a long haul flight followed by another one that was delayed by one hour with aggressive crew members. I would never fly with Scoot again even if it means paying more.";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Berlin to Bangkok via Singapore";2022-01-04 00:00:00;10;10;10;10;10;10;10;"no"

While I understand the logic in a bid where the misc fees already paid for seats, food etc. would boost the chances of securing the upgrade, I don't see the case since we were already onboard, had reasonably comfortable seats, with meals reserved and couldn't take advantage of the additional baggage that an upgrade provided and so didn't proceed. Scoot could have earned additional $362 if both of us had upgraded without incurring additional costs but it didn't happen because of its illogical pricing and many ScootPlus seats were left empty. Mid-flight I walked around the cabin only to realised that many rows of first row seats in economy were empty when it was indicated full when I made my seat reservations. Be it technical glitch or last min cancellations, saving grace would be for the cabin crew to offer to shift me and my partner or the guy next to us given we had indicated that we were unhappy that our row was the only one completely full, but no initiative was taken. I'm also still waiting for my miles from the bid to upgrade to be credited. Yes, it's a miserable 302 miles but Scoot should honour what it promised.

Lucky there was not much traffic at 4:30am. On another note, we had to wait on board upon landing before being allowed to leave the aircraft because the custom officers had not started working.

On a separate ticket, we're flying to Singapore this morning on tickets purchased through Singapore Airlines online.

However, as the flight was operated by SilkAir and they allow only 30kg each. The ticketing agents at Chiang Mai airport are only contractors and are completely unempowered to make any decisions. The Silk Air supervisor, made a ridiculous attempt to call someone to get permission and could only tell me no and that he was sorry, which I appreciated only slightly, but sorry didn't solve our problem. We had 10kg too much and he was not budging. Finally, we unloaded as much as we could into carry-on bags and we we're still 4kg over. He would not budge. Any amount of reasoning would not work. Finally, he whimpered off and hid from me. The contract agent, who was embarrassed, finally just told him it was at weight and put our bags through.

We proceeded to call them and waited for 5 HOURS for them to call us back, in which they said there was nothing they could do to reimburse us. I asked to speak with the representative's manager, to which he snarkily said sure, and hung up on us. I have never experienced such a terrible customer service experience.

The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable.

"Sky Express Airlines";1;"'''No responsibility, no liability'''";"16th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"Let me start by first off saying, this airline should be put out of business! Me and my wife just spent 2 weeks in Greece for our honeymoon. We visited 3 Greek islands including Milos. We flew with Sky Express from Milos to Athens, and then from Athens to Zakynthos. The plane was an older, smaller dual prop plane. No real problem there for a 20 min flight. However, we were forced to check our carry on luggage as was most of the other people on this flight. When we arrived in Athens we were informed that everyone’s checked luggage had been left in Milos! Only 2 bags had been put on the plane. My wife got very lucky as hers was one of the bags that was on the plane. We were told in Athens the plane was too heavy so the baggage had to be left behind. No one told any of us on the flight about this issue when we boarded! One problem with that, the flight was only about half full! I literally could have put my bag in an empty seat! Upon complaining at the Skyserv desk for lost luggage, I was told this happens quite often and that my bag would be put on the next flight which arrived several hours later. We were staying the night in Athens at the airport hotel so it was easy for me to follow up with. Long story short, it did not arrive on the next flight, in fact, it was not put on the next 3 flights! We took out flight the next day to Zakynthos, and upon arrival I had to find a store and spend money to buy at least a bathing suit so I could enjoy the pool at our hotel. My bag didn’t show up in Zakynthos until the end of our second day there. All in all, I was 3 days without any of my things or clean clothes, on my honeymoon! We were supposed to receive a call, when my bag reached Athens so we could be told which flight it would be on to Zakynthos, big surprise, no call! Now a little bit about this company. While trying to reach somebody, anybody to find our where my lost luggage was, I did some research about SkyExpress Airline. Turns out this airline was started by an investment group owned by a wealthy Greek man. However, the only actual employees that work for SkyExpress are the pilots and the flight attendants. This wealthy Greek man is a very smart guess. When starting SkyExpress, he also started a company called Skyserv. Skyserv is the company that takes care of all of the ticketing services etc, for SkyExpress Airline. They are the ones that I had to deal with when my luggage was left in Milos. Now if you talk to them to complain about SkyExpress, the company line is “I’m sorry, we don’t work for SkyExpress, but here is a phone number you can call for assistance.? All of their paperwork has the line, “We take no responsibility or liability for any problems or issues with luggage.? So here’s the deal, if you call the aforementioned phone number for SkyExpress, its only for a reservationist, who tells you for any complaints, you have to send an email. I sent a complaint email that night, guess what, no response. I have a strong feeling that complaints go right in the deleted bin. So SkyServ will not take complaints because they don’t work for SkyExpress, and SkyExpress has no customer service, so basically if you have any problem with SkyExpress you’re basically screwed. Very clever business setup. No responsibility, no liability.";;"Couple Leisure";"Economy Class";"Milos to Zakynthos via Athens";2023-01-07 00:00:00;10;10;;10;;;10;"no"

Later we were told via email that we needed to be there 20 mins early but we were 30 mins early! Either way, we purchased new tickets and were given contact info for Sky Express to receive a refund of our taxes due to the missed flight. After our trip ended, I contacted the airline and provided all of our info and was told I would be reimbursed within 30 days. Well 30 days passed, then 60, then 90, and I was following up regularly via email but NO responses from anyone. Finally I called the airline and was told they reimbursed me in August to a card ending in 6237 but my card ends in 7237 so there is a mistake and I did not receive my reimbursement. They kept telling me they processed it and there was nothing further they could do. I provided proof of my purchase using MY credit card, and screenshots of my credit card statement, and they still kept telling me they reimbursed me (but to a card that I don't own). Finally they sent me ''proof'' of reimbursement, which is totally laughable, because the ''proof'' showed that they reimbursed a MASTERCARD in my husband's name ending in 6237 (which is not his card, and he only has a Visa), meanwhile it was MY VISA that was used to purchase the tickets - so how can you reimburse someone else who did not make the original purchase? What sense does that make? and to a card that doesn't exist! This has fraud written all over it and I will not rest until they are caught.

I have a back injury and sitting long haul is difficult, so I was hoping to be able to stretch a little. I fly this route regularly, and always book this seat if it is available, and pay to do so in advance. As soon as I reached my seat I noticed the tray tables in that row were down. The purser for Economy was standing there and said she would have to move me. I asked why. ''Because these seats are blocked off for the crew,'' she said. If they were blocked of how was I able to book that seat? And it is the seat I always book, I have never seen it ''blocked off.'' I explained to her that I had booked it specifically and she just stared at me. I felt very uncomfortable. She then blocked off two window seats at the side with her own luggage, forbidding another paying passenger hoping to sit there during flight (15 hours). Her bag stayed on that seat during flight as well as during taxiing, take-off and landing, unsecured, and despite turbulence. Twice during the night another cabin crew member told me abruptly that someone would be sitting in my row as their entertainment system wasn't working (several do not). I did not object. But that person never materialized. So what is SAA's policy about this last row, and also about bullying passengers? Finally, the same purser and an older female cabin crew member who had been working forward, also spent a lot of time complaining audibly about another crew member whom the purser said she would ''like to stab in the back'', it was incredibly unprofessional.'";"A340-600";"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Johannesburg to New York";2019-01-10 00:00:00;30;10;30;40;20;;30;"no"

Apart from the desserts, I found the food  not that much better than what's served in economy class.

I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was ''on the way''. When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, ''why don't you just walk?'' I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ''worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers''. Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs. When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair (in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher) and I know that's not true. If they don't want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight. Then I would go to another airline.

From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises. I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline.

On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're in the air to Tampa, citing ''weather''. After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% of other airlines were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality, there were. We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And they weren't canceled! We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board. From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep. After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person. Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight. There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn’t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport. I don’t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart. SW used to be my “go-to? airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline’s inconsistency with flights). If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their “customary playbook? profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important. The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts: ''Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver.'' Southwest cancelled our flight in the morning and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option. Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us. SW does not offer this. Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly. We are disgusted with the treatment we received. They are losing loyal customers left and right. Why do they keep treating your passengers this way?

When I spoke to the CS, they informed me that they had ''just'' got the information and that is the reason why nobody was informed. They directed me to their ticket office to air my complaint. There were 2 young women in there, I proceeded to ask one of them if there was an earlier flight, she said she would check and walked out. The other one quietly informed me that there was no other flight. The other one came back (as though she had consulted someone) and said she checked and there were no more flights.  I then left to check in and was shocked that the BP said boarding time was 8.45pm, meaning they had known long enough to print it out on the BP. My checks revealed the plane had not been on time for the past 3 weeks. Very disappointed with the horrible service and lack of empathy.

Worried about missing my connecting flight, I call their customer service center about 10 times to no avail. I get to the airport early, and their desk isn't even open until 9pm. I talk to the agent, who confirms I will miss my connecting flight from Sun Country, then offers a ''refund of flight'' or ''flight on 1/2 out of MSP.'' Refund of flight is useless, as all the other last minute flights are 2-3x more expensive. An alternate flight 3 days later is a joke, given Sun Country doesn't offer any hotel accommodations and basically wants to leave a customer stranded in a random city for 3 days. I eat up the cost of an exorbitantly more expensive last minute flight, and follow up with their customer service via email, phone, SNS multiple times. No response for 3 weeks. Then, I get an email saying like ''we're really sorry, so as a sign of our commitment to excellent customer service, we've refunded you your original ticket price.'' This almost feels insulting, that the only remuneration offered is the money for the flight I never got to set foot on due to a malfunctioning or error on Sun Country's part.

After waiting for over an hour on the phone to talk to a customer service rep, I was met with hostility and an absolute disregard and resounding lack of accommodation or alternative to my situation. I consider traveling by air an expensive privilege and one that I am extremely grateful for but one I do not have the luxury of doing so very often. I am also conscious of cancelation/rescheduling charges and terms during normal times but during these unprecedented times, I think it is so important for businesses to value their customers and vise versa. I was so disappointed at the lack of transparency by Sun Country when this credit was issued and I was not fully informed that the credit would expire. The lack of transparency by Sun Country coupled with the uncertainty of traveling until deemed safe by CDC and federal officials made planning future plans almost impossible and now that it seems like the nation is in the clear, Sun Country has made it unattainable for me.

We go through customs, get our luggage and head outside to our bus. Waiting on the hot bus until 4:30 they offered us $5USD beer. When they finally started driving we were in rush hour.

Trying to be creative in saving money, Sunwing started combining flights from Toronto to two different destinations (although the TripCentral web-site, were we bought our vacation packages showed 'Direct flight') - in our case they detoured us through Los Cabos before dropping off in our final destination of Ixtapa (Los Cabos and Ixtapa are almost 2 hrs of flight apart). We had to go through the customs in Los Cabos, collect our luggage and go through the whole check-in routing again. Normal flight that should take 5 hrs, took 9-10 hours instead, and for that time it would have been easier to fly to Europe. The crew only gave us soft drinks during the whole ordeal and as a bonus - tiny packs of cookies during the second leg of the journey. Due to lack of time in the interim destination they did not clean seats properly and the magazine pocket of my seat 28F contained traces of snacks from the previous passenger. On the way back fellow-passengers who flew from Toronto to Las Cabos via Ixtapa, had to disembark at Ixtapa, go through all that jazz with customs/luggage/check-in and in addition customs took away all the goods bought at the Duty Free in Toronto and charged them penalty.

"Sunwing Airlines";1;"'''completely disorganized'''";"16th January 2020";"VERDADERO";"I did an all-inclusive family trip to Cancún, Mexico from Toronto, Canada. Hands down the worst service I have ever had with an airline. The return flight was a complete mess, from the resort pickup (which is provided by Sunwing) - the bus was late about 50mins. At this point in time, many are starting to get hungry as it is close to 6 PM. No one wants to leave for fear that the bus shows up and we are left behind. At the resort it is stressed by Sunwing representatives that you have to be in the lobby for pickup, the bus will not wait for you and if pickup is missed you have to find your own way and pay yourself. With the bus being almost an hour late, all of us could have gone to grab something to eat for free while still at the resort with our wristbands on. Many people, myself included checked out early from our rooms thinking the bus was going to pick us up on time. I could have had the room longer and had my 80-year-old grandma who was travelling with me be more relaxed, instead of checking out early and waiting in the lobby and for hours. Upon arriving at the airport to check-in some Sunwings employees started to inform people that our flight was delayed an hour and 45mins and then other employees not informing any of us at all. I had overheard this at the counter beside where I was checking in and luckily the lady checking in was from my resort and she said “Hey! Did you just here this? The flights delayed over an hour!? I asked the guy who was checking me in at the moment and he then said “Oh yeah it’s late? (as if this isn’t something important). At the gate, many people still had no clue the flight was delayed and said no one told them when they checked in. After seeing a plane land around the time our original flight (9:40 PM) was supposed to depart, all of us thought okay it’s on time. We’re going to go home on time. Employees at the gate then informed us that this plane is picking up passengers to go to Montreal instead and that we had to wait till 11 PM when another plane would be coming. More and more passengers started to complain that the employees then started telling us different times of when we will be departing. Everyone got fed up and we asked for a manager we were told the manager would be coming in 5 mins, 20mins past and then we were told the manager isn’t there but a supervisor said he would come. No one came for another 10mins, then a random Sunwing employee came and proceed to lie as well. Then finally she said a plane is in the air and it will be here at around 11:30 PM and we should be taking off at 12:30 AM. At this point we have been here at the airport several hours, stores are closed and there’s nothing for us to buy. Some passengers asked for food vouchers but we were told they were not approved to give any out to us. If we wanted we can send in a complaint online to Sunwing. A fee other things happened but long story short, the plane was up in the air at exactly 12:38 AM and we arrived in Toronto at 3:54 AM. After waiting for luggage, going through customs and taking a taxi, I arrived home at around 5:20 AM. Resulting in calling into work at 7:30 AM to say I won’t be coming in due to this delayed flight, thus losing a day’s worth of pay. Will never ever fly Sungwing again and definitely do not recommend flying them either. Their customer service is absolutely horrible and they’re completely disorganized!

A bit of a nuisance, but such things often happen with domestic flights in Indonesia. Ten minutes before departure the plane was nowhere to be seen, so surely there would be a delay, which eventually was announced. Strangely I received simultaneously a phone call from their mother company, Lion Air, informing the Super Air Jet flight was cancelled and me being re-booked on a Lion Air flight leaving in 30 mins. Officially the original Super Air Jet was not cancelled, and I presented myself at the gate asking for information, telling about the phone call I had received. The gate agent told me I was was right and I would receive a new boarding card. Others were standing at the gate and overheard the conversation and asked the agent why they were not informed, not to mention re-booked or to receive the same service. No answers given to the others and indeed I received five minutes later a new printed boarding pass for my Lion Air flight. I was the only one offered this. Interesting was that the Lion Air flight was 2/3 booked. Upon arrival in Jakarta I checked on my original Super Air Jet flight and saw it left Lombok one hour after Lion Air left. Don’t know what triggered this whole thing, also because the original flight to be taken wasn’t overbooked. On the other hand I was grateful for the re-booking. The conclusion of me flying with Super Air Jet is I would love to write a report about them, if one day they give me the opportunity to effectively fly with them and they don’t re-book: two times out of two I was bumped off.";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"Lombok to Jakarta";2022-01-09 00:00:00;;;;20;;;30;"no"

Later I cancelled my Flex ticket for 11th October from Paramaribo to Port-of-Spain on Sep 07 2018 (9 weeks ago) because my schedule changed. The cancellation was in time and acknowledged by the customer service via e-mail. First Suriname Airways wanted to charge 40$ for the cancellation. Only after I reminded the staff that the Flex rate explicitly said ''cancellation free'' they agreed on refunding the whole price. Since then, for more than 5 weeks now I have been continuously asking about the processing of the case. The answer by the customer service is always: ''we redirected your request to the financial department''. No further action was taken beyond these words. It is obvious that Suriname Airways wants to postpone and will apparently never pay me back. I can only warn against booking flights with this Airline. It seems like they are not able to manage the most basic needs an Airline should provide its customers such as consistent information or customer service. It seems to me that the flights themselves are acceptable, if everything goes smooth. Seats, on-board service are alright. But if unexpected difficulties pop up, like delay or cancellation, expect Suriname Airways not being able to handle the situation or even to take advantage out of it - as in my case.

When checking in, I had the problem that I had to confirm that I had a yellow fever vaccination. Since I couldn't do that, I contacted the airline. She told me that I really need one. So I had to cancel my flight a few hours before departure and book a new flight and now have 809 euros + 350 euros additional costs. Ultimately, after IATA and the Embassy of South Africa, I wouldn't have needed one. The contact runs via Whats App, which is more than catastrophic. The embassy from Angola has also been blazing with absolute ignorance for the past 3 weeks. I would definitely not fly with them again and I can really advise everyone against this airline.  Im Januar 2023 sollte es für mich ursprünglich mit Taag über Luanda nach Cape Town gehen. Beim Einchecken hatte ich das Problem, dass ich bestätigen musste, dass ich über eine Gelbfieberimpfung verfüge. Da ich das nicht konnte, habe ich mich mit der Airline in Verbindung gesetzt. Diese gab mir gegenüber an, dass ich wirklich eine benötige. Ich musste also ein paar Stunden vor Abflug meinen Flug stornieren und einen neuen Flug buchen und habe nun 809 Euro + 350 Euro Mehrkosten. Letztendlich hätte ich aber nach IATA und der Botschaft von Südafrika doch keine gebraucht. Der Kontakt läuft über Whats App, was mehr als katastrophal ist.

"TAG Airlines";2;"'''Flight personnel very unprofessional'''";"17th November 2021";"VERDADERO";"' Flight to Cancun was excellent. I love the jet prop Saab 340. Flight personnel very unprofessional. Never any information from the pilot. Elevation, weather etc. No service. Just water. The return flight was terrible. We departed 21 Oct at 23.00 instead of 14.10. Little information from TAG. Only gave us water. We didn't arrive in Guatemala City, instead they landed in Flores at 01.00, 22 Oct, and put us up in a hotel. We departed 22 Oct at 08.00, arriving in Guatemala City at 09.00. The entire experience was 19 hours, instead of 2 hrs 10 min. On landing in Guate City we were promised a free return flight to Cancun. But they didn't explain how to receive it. I'm sure they don't want us to go through the red tape to claim it. I chose TAG instead of conventional Volaris A320 jet because I wanted a bit of adventure? The departure from Cancun was set as 14.10. I arrived at the gate coming from Valladolid 40 min. before boarding. Perfect timing? TAG first posted a 30 delay departure, and then endlessly extended it on the board, without speaking to the waiting passengers. Finally TAG said, the plane had been hit by lightening and they are sending a replacement plane and departure was set for 20.00. I don't believe it was lightening, I suspect it was equipment failure. We should come to the gate at 19.30. I sat and waited at the gate for an hour becoming thoroughly chilled by the AC and then decided to take the 30 min. ADO bus back to the terminal downtown and look for a pleasant restaurant. Good choice. When I returned to the gate the German group of four were surprised to learn that a passenger can leave the terminal and return. They were jealous. Departure was repeatedly pushed forward and we confronted the timid man at the gate and he told us, 'Oh, the replacement plane is on the way. Be here soon'. Airlines always lie to passengers. We were then told we would depart at 22.00, landing at Guate 23.00 local time. (2 hr flight, and one hr time change.) That didn't happen either. Then they began moving departure forward 10 minutes each 10 minutes. The plane arrived and we departed at 23.00, set to arrive 24.00 Guate time. I put in earplugs to shield the rattle of the Saab 340 and slept soundly awakening to the plane touching down. ''This doesn't look like Guate airport.'' The pilot landed at the wrong airport? No. Bad fog at Guate and inadequate radar, so we landed at Flores Guatemala at 01.00 and it then took them 1.5 hrs to get us to a hotel. I slept from 02.30 to 06.00, feeling quite good. Many passengers were angry. We had only been given water once all these hours, and no food, and little information. Two brave Guatemala men stood and berated the TAG staff. I jumped in and said, ''What do we want? A hotel room immediately, and a full refund of our tickets.'' Silence. We departed Flores at 08.00 for Guate and the flight was fine. Weather good.

I was never given an opportunity to take anything out of my suitcase or rearrange my things, instead she took the trolley and asked me to pay £68 straight away.

"Thai Lion Air";1;"'''definitely my last flight'''";"2nd March 2019";"VERDADERO";"'  My company bought me a Thai Lion Air ticket (Bangkok - Bali) through an agent and was told that pre-booking of luggage could only be made by the passenger personally and not by an agent. On the day before my departure I made five attempts to pre-book luggage through Lion Air's webpage (20 kgs, 25 US$ according to the table), but I got the same ''System error'' message each time I tried. At last I contacted the call center, but was kept waiting for a lenghty period and didn't have time to wait till the end. On the day of departure I went to the airport prepared to be charged a fee for un-booked luggage (expecting double or triple charge), but upon checkin I was met with a luggage charge of 320 US$ - equal to 13 times the pre-booked rate and double the price of the entire plane ticket. The staff were uninterested in the fact that their webpage didn't work. Long story short - I decided to buy an entirely new ticket for the same flight with 20 kgs included (150 US$). Having once again fallen prey to Lion Air's scams, this was definitely my last flight with that airline. Taking into consideration the airline's atrocious safety record and appalling business methods, I don't recommend anyone using this airline unless there are no other alternatives.'";"Boeing 737-900";"Business";"Economy Class";"Bangkok to Denpasar Bali";2019-01-02 00:00:00;20;20;20;10;10;10;10;"no"

I booked this flight months in advance but found it difficult to find out if I could check in on line. I was eventually told no. A day before the flight I was sent an email asking if I wanted to check in on line. I tried around 10 times but their system crashed every time. When we arrived at DMK we asked where we should check in we were directed to a queue which didn’t move for 20 minutes. I asked again and was told that our check in desk was at the other end of the terminal. Although I had already paid to upgrade my luggage allowance they tried to charge me again. They also changed my seat allocation without informing me and unfortunately I did not check. The situation at the boarding gate was chaotic and, at times, downright dangerous. Our flight was significantly delayed but there was never any notification that it had been, let alone why. Gates were being changed and, at one time, three different flights from two different airlines were being told that they were boarding form the same gate. There was zero communication from the gate staff who seemed as confused as the passengers as to what was happening. Several ugly scenes arose as flights were boarded without anyone knowing which one. Twice we tried to board the wrong flight. Twice our flight disappeared completely from the indicator board and no one at the desk could explain why. The leg room on the flight was derisory and, while I am not the slimmest person on the planet, I do expect to be able to lower my table fully. This was truly the most awful flight experience I have ever experienced and we have flown with Ryanair several times. We will never fly with this airline again.

Never used this airline before, but had no reason to think it would be any different to the many long haul flights we have taken over the years. Wrong! We had no idea we were flying with a long haul version of Ryanair. Nice clean plane, decent amount of leg room with rather uncomfortable seats. We had had to pay £25 each way to choose our seats or risk the real possibility of having to sit separately on a 10 hour flight, which had already added £100 to the cost of holiday. The overhead lockers are quite small, and the baggage allowance is a measly 20kg hold and 6kg hand luggage which is strictly adhered to. On the return journey we were 1.2kg overweight, and were charged £20 by the completely inflexible ground staff - no receipt given, and cash only payment. Have been overweight by this trivial amount several times on other airlines, but have never ever been charged! Disgusting daylight robbery. On board we got settled in and once in the air the drinks trolley came. We were charged £2.80 for a cup of tea! I thought it was a joke , but everything was to pay for, at 10 times the cost of the supermarket (1.30 for a kit kat!) The only free drinks were a bottle of water on the outbound flight (none on the return) and the tea with the two meals, which was half the size of the one you had to buy. We also got a complimentary cornetto on the outbound flight, which was so small it was gone in two bites. The out meals were quite nice, coming back the breakfast consisted of a yoghurt and a cake, Who eats cake for breakfast? Turns out we do, because we are starving !

"Thomas Cook Airlines";2;"'''very poor service'''";"17th October 2017";"FALSO";"'  Manchester to Portland via New York JFK. Good points: Smooth flights and food okay. Bad points: Booked premium economy at approx £500 extra, as it was our first long haul journey. Arrived at the airport and checked in, no problem. After going through security, found that our first flight was delayed by two hours. No problem as we had a four hour layover at JFK. During the flight, drinks were 'included'' but they only came round once except for a wine with our meal! I know it doesn't specify how many drinks but you do expect more than one service! Just before landing we were informed that a representative from Thomas Cook would be there to assist us with our onward journey, once we had cleared immigration. At immigration we were told we had to collect our cases and check them in with JetBlue for the next leg of our journey. Baggage transfer was also supposed to be included in the premium package. We collected our bags and looked for the person from Thomas Cook. We couldn't see them so found our way to the correct terminal and to the JetBlue check in desk. The queue was so long that we missed the flight, despite them putting us in the priority lane. When we reached the desk we were told that we had already been booked on a later flight - instead of travelling at 4.59pm we had been booked on to the 22.40pm flight! Not impressed as you can imagine as we reached our final destination over five hours late. When we arrived at Portland Jetport for the first leg of our return journey we couldn't check in as there was a problem with the ticketing. Even though we had the paperwork and it was showing on the airlines system that we were booked on it, they said a change had been made and they would have to contact Thomas Cook to rectify it. This was taking ages and at one point, the JetBlue staff said it would be unlikely that we would make the flight. We eventually got our boarding passes and made it to gate just 15 minutes before it opened! After a five hour layover at JFK we were finally on the last leg. Only one drinks service on the return journey, even though it was a night flight, would have been good to be offered tea or coffe or other soft drink.

As a previous reviewer described in their situation, check in for Thomas Cook was mobbed on my return flight originating in Manchester. The only thing that saved me from waiting in the outrageously long que was having paid for a premium seat. As he was checking me in, the representative did not inform me that the flight had had a change of aircraft and would not be offering premium service. He also did not inform me that my luggage was not checked all the way through and that I would have to pick it up in Boston and check it in again, another mob scene. I learned of the change in my flight when I noticed a pile of papers on the counter and read about it there. A refund was promised and a link to an online form to obtain it given. Questions to the company representative ''helping'' me from behind the counter were met with rudeness. Others were not so fortunate and were informed for the first time while actually on the flight.  At this stage I have gone through numerous contortions in attempting to obtain the promised refund of the additional charge for premium service. The online form seems deliberately designed to rebuff non UK residents, it only accepts UK addresses. Thomas Cook has no telephone number in the US. Although I found one listed online as being theirs, the first time I tried it was answered by someone telling me that it was a Thomas Cook line only at a certain time of day. When I called back at the time I was told to, I was informed it is never a Thomas Cook line at any time of day. This is a great way to communicate to your US customers that they are of no importance to you, Thomas Cook. Eventually, I managed to make contact through email, both requesting my refund and reporting about my horrible in flight experience, which included not being offered an unpaid beverage outside the meal service- on a transatlantic flight (while standing in the long line of people attempting to get a boarding pass in Boston, I chatted with someone who'd been in the regular economy class on the same flight who told me they had been offered complimentary beverages twice outside of meal services). When we were offered the chance to purchase beverages, water was not offered. I felt I was reduced to begging for it, and was handed a tiny plastic cup of water each time I did. I eventually did hear back from the company by email, requesting the information they needed to deposit the money into my bank account. There was no concern or interest expressed in the ordeal I had outlined on the flight in regard to beverages or at the connecting airport where I was given incorrect information by the person accepting my luggage back in wearing a Thomas Cook uniform. Her lack of knowledge resulted in my standing in a line unnessarily and wasting my precious time on the layover. To date, no refund has been provided. When I wrote again to the same email address stating this, I recieved a response stating that I ''had been offered a CHAPS payment'' and that they considered the matter to be resolved.

"Transaero Airlines";5;"Transaero Airlines customer review";"28th August 2011";"FALSO";"LHR-DME-SVX Decided on Transaero as the price was quite good compared to other companies and an excellent safety record. Premium Economy on the outward flight and Economy on the inbound flight. Flew on aging Boeing 737's and decor was faded. We were put in the front row on both legs outbound as we were traveling with our children. However the airline doesn't supply bassinets. The onboard service to Moscow was good with helpful FA's and for the first time I can remember we were given the baby and child's meal I had ordered. The leg room in Premium Economy is excellent and I would recommend Premium Economy on this airline if you are flying with children. The problems started in Moscow. We were told that we had to pick up our baggage in Moscow but we had prepared ourselves for that. However when checking our baggage into Moscow the airline refused to take our buggy past security as they did at Heathrow and insisted it be placed into the hold as luggage. We were told it was either too heavy too complicated or some other reason. The reason was made clear as they said don't worry about having to carry your son because you can hire a buggy which can be taken past security for 200RUB. This is a blatant rip-off and a cheap attempt to make money and the Transaero representative was rude and offensive even for Russian customer services. We felt we had no choice but to hire one and we boarded the connecting flight. The service was not as good and the FA's had a bored and disinterested approach although we did get our child and baby meal again. On our return flight we were told that we didn't have to pick up our luggage at Moscow but that the buggy would have to be taken into the airplane and we would have to pay another 200RUB in Moscow. At Moscow we also discovered that for some reason the check-in assistant had put myself my son and my wife in random seats in the aircraft to London and it was only with a fellow passenger agreeing to move that we could sit together. When another passenger asked what was going on and we explained she just shrugged and said that's what you get when you fly Transaero The service was a bit erratic to London when we asked for a pillow for our sleeping son after take off was told curtly that they had run out and quite a few were impatient with other passengers.The food was quite good on all legs but no drinks runs were made. Only the London Moscow flight had any IFE which was an old Soviet cartoon played on a VHS player. However to listen to it you had to pay 200RUB for the headphones. On the Moscow London flight they were handing out portable media players to watch movies but you had to pay 500RUB to hire one. The trip had some good areas when the service is good it is good. It has the potential to be a very good airline but it needs to be more consistent with its service on the flight and stop trying to add extra charges before and during the flights and as with other Russian airlines it falls down badly on customer service. It is 2-star airline but it could be so much better.";;;"Premium Economy";;;;;;;;;40;"no"

I had an important, urgent medical appointments on July 7th and 8th morning (thanks to those appointments a surgery was planned). The problem had to be solved immediately, so I contacted them via What'sApp, replies took time, I decided to call them. The call lasted 38 minutes. They offered me 3 solutions : Another flight on for 13th of July. Doesn't work for me. Reimburse my ticket,  but doesn't solve my problem. Get another flight from another company.  Yes, but the condition was to ''find a new ticket with a reasonable price close to the initial one''. To be more precise, I paid 98€, they told me I should find something under 150€. If you book a flight the same day, of course all the prices are going to be high! So taking into account the high prices of flights for that day, the service agent made me understand that I won't be fully reimbursed, therefore I'll have to pay extra money. I could finally find a flight for 198€, sent a mail and I'll see if they pay it. An overall opinion is horrible. I had feeling they were mocking me offering a solution which wasn't a solution at all even thought I explained the importance of being in Paris for me. I'll try to avoid this company in the future as much as I can. The only positive point is the service agent who was adorable, really understood my problem and tried to help me, but couldn't do it due to her limits.

Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without).

Mid-flight, the food trolley came past and over priced snacks were available for purchase - yes, despite the cost of the flight. Landing in Innsbruck, we seemed to be prioritized behind Austrian airlines when it came to baggage claim (even though we arrived first). We will never fly Transavia again.

On such a long flight, I expected to see everyone wearing their masks correctly (except for eating & drinking, but people were not wearing their masks (correctly) for hours). The flight crew didn’t say anything, only when I asked them directly they managed to ask a woman in front of us to put on her mask. She did, but as soon as the flight attendant was gone, she made an obscene gesture towards a sign that told the passengers to wear masks and proceeded to free her nose. When we in process of landing, one of the flight attendants was standing directly in front of us, next to us was a man that didn’t wear any mask at all and loudly talked to his neighbour in the middle row. Both didn’t wear their masks, but the flight attendant didn’t say anything at all. I am very disappointed with the crew and especially with TUI fly for not enforcing basic hygiene rules despite the Covid-19 pandemic still going on.

I was supposed to fly with my infant daughter and my mother a 3 hour direct trip from Chania to Brussels on 30 June. Two weeks before the flight we received a message that our flight would take 6 hours due to a stopover in Kos Island. I called the airline and asked what it was about - they said no worries, a small stopover, you will not need to disembark. Ok, suboptimal but acceptable til now. On the day of the flight, we check in normally, and when we look to take our seats, they were occupied. I tell the attendants that I must sit with my infant daughter and mother, and they just say to randomly take seats because the plane is totally unoccupied. Ok. We sit. I then ask if we have to switch to our assigned seats on the Kos stopover, because it will be extremely difficult for me to carry the baby, all the baby bags, and my own stuff, wake the baby up (she sleeps at takeoff), and move. They say we'll do our best for you to keep your seats. At Kos we are suddenly announced to disembark because they have to fuel up and the policy is no passengers during fueling (although all the crew remained on board).  What a mess. Talked to other discontent passengers, many had huge delays when flying into Chania in the first place (ex. flight scheduled for 6 am finally takes off at 8 am). Then get back on the plane to the assigned seats, try to calm the baby down, etc. Of couse needless to say nobody helped with the baby. I'm glad we arrived safe and that our luggage was not lost.

Departed on the TU790 on the 06th April. The flight was over 2 hours late arriving into London on the inbound so did not depart until some time after the STD. Outbound aircraft (TS-IMH) was very old (1994) and extremely dirty inside. The cabin crew were not very happy and showed this in the service or lack of during the flight. Meals were simply a piece of bread with cheese and chicken and 1 service of drinks. The most memorable part of the flight was going to the rear cabin once the food and drinks service was concluded. The cabin crew (6 members) were having a wonderful time socialising with no regard or interest in the passengers. The return flight that I took on the 13th April as the return leg (TU791) was operated by a much newer (2013) aeroplane (TS-IMV). However again clearly Tunis Air have either a very poor outsourced company which do the aircraft cleaning in Tunis Airport or they simply do not clean their planes in order to save costs? At least 1 cabin crew member was on board who operated the flight a week earlier. Unfortunately again the service was a complete repeat of the earlier flight. Tunis Air are under increasing pressure I am informed to perform as an airline who frankly have not for some time. However if this is an indication of the measures they are taking to improve the service then I do not hold much hope for the airline going forward and once EZY start their service from STN-MIR in June I will be switching my business to them.";;;"Economy Class";;;30;10;10;;10;;10;"no"

In ATL and DEL, I had to spend extra time on the check-in counter to have the family sit together because Turkish decided to assign us different seats in different rows of the airplane. The food service as well was very disappointing. While going from ATL to DEL, where we had opted for Asian Vegetarian meals and Hindu Vegetarian meals, we were given boiled spinach, white rice and boiled corn. On the return flight from DEL to ATL, we had not made food selection given the bad experience in our ATL-DEL flight. To our surprise, this time, there were no options in food other than beef.

None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time. Got to the counter and was told by that the flight was in fact delayed 2 hours and we would miss our connection and they knew about it 4 hours prior to me asking. So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home). They were not willing to do that all they said they could do was put us on the delayed flight and put me on a later flight to JFK, which now I miss connection from JFK to Florida and I need a hotel in New York.  So my friend and I check in same time with same person, but when I get to JFK I have no luggage and she does. They placed my luggage on the flight to Istanbul the next morning.

When in reality, you simply fill in the SG arrival pass and you are good to go. Which I explained and told her exactly where she could find this information.  I turned to the other gate agent and showed my passport and let me on the flight. While on my trip I had my trip rescheduled twice and I spotted something different with my flight. It seemed like my flight had been split up into two single journeys instead of a connecting one. Which would mean I had to check out my luggage and check it in again during my transfer. So I call their agents asking to confirm if this is the case and to double check if my tickets are still connecting. First one said bit to quickly, yes everything is fine with your tickets no worry. I message their facebook page to ask the same question with more details, they say it’s no issue and they tickets are connected.

As if that wasn't enough, they cancelled this already rebooked inhumane flight 10 hours before departure. Turkish Airlines only needed a short email to cancel without any possible contacts or other options. At the airport, the fun really started. Seeing that the flight was still available and that more and more people with the same problem were piling up, Turkish Airlines still didn't have enough reason to act. 10 minutes before the end of check-in, they were content to calmly do something.

I bought 3 tickets for myself, my wife and my 19 month old son since we need extra room when we are flying. We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey.

What was supposed to be an 9h trip turned into a four day nightmare that cost me upwards of $2800 USD in out of pocket expenses, in addition to the original ticket price. I was shocked to find some United employees incredibly lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive. On day three of the ordeal, a customer service rep at Newark took a cursory look at my booking, claimed I was rebooked on an air Canada flight and was “no longer a United passenger.? I told her, the booking was not complete and Air Canada had explained (after I had gone back and forth between the two long queues) that United had not actually booked me, it was more of a temporary hold. The United staff refused to even speak to me, even as I begged tears streaming down my face explaining I had a family emergency. A manager then aggressively threatened to call security if I didn’t step aside because I “had already used up 30 minutes of their time,? which she knew was a blatant lie. I then had to go back to Air Canada and then called United on the phone, all of which was useless. I finally booked myself on a new ticket, via the United app, travelled to another terminal (C) and waited for 8 hours only to have that trip cancelled as well. I was now approaching day 4 so feeling utterly defeated, I booked myself a business class ticket home from Newark with Air Canada. It cost me $2300 USD and was a red eye with a long layover in Quebec City, but that flight DID make it and I’m now home. I think United deserves to be sued for its failure to support and look after the wellbeing of its customers.

However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were ''no problem''. I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, ''don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute''. I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled.

Second-only a blanket was available for each passenger, no pillows available on an all-night flight. Third-no beverages were made available even in first class. Fourth-at no time did any of the crew apologize for the delay or for the lack of amenities. Fifth-the plane itself had no electronics available at all - no video screens and no outlets for electronics - truly very Spartan. Sixth-at 7am EDT the first beverages were offered along with the ''first class'' continental breakfast which consisted of a small croissant roll, a packet of almond butter, a small tube of strawberry preserves, a wedge of cheese and a mint - not ''first class'' at all.

We sat in row 22, right in front of the bathroom which kept me up all night. I got 1 hour of sleep on an 11 hour flight. 10 days later, we flew back to Philadelphia on the same aircraft. It was the exact same experience, (minus the bathroom as we were sitting a few rows up) plus incredibly rude flight attendants. We landed pretty early, so waited on the tarmac for quite a while. After some time, I started to feel the urge to go to the bathroom. After 15 minutes I got up to use the bathroom. At that time, a flight attendant turned around and shouted at me ''sit down, you can't get up yet''. We still didn't move for another 5 minutes.

I have already called customer service to try and expedite my time in this line, but they can only help with rescheduling the flight and not with the hotel.

The flight finally got off the ground 4 hours and 45 minutes later than scheduled. Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me. For my return flight from Philadelphia they announced that there would be a 10 minute delay because - you guessed it - they were short on personnel. The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying.

Here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through Customs and Immigration and re-check our baggage for our final destination. However the plane was one hour late in boarding in St. Lucia. Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so. Then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our de-planing. Once at the gate we were told that Customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane. At this point we had 1 hour left to get through Customs and Immigration re-check our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take- off. My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board. I begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge. We went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day. So with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage. We were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline. By the way our flight from St. Lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left.

If you pay an under-the-counter fee she will change the name on the reservation on your name and you got your seat. Same during check-in : they will ask you to put your hand bag/computer/whatever on to the scale. If you are somehow +20 they will start to make faces and convince you that it will be too expensive if you pay official fee. They will ask you to pay half of the money that you'll pay officially directly to check in staff. I don't do that now as the official fee is also is not that much. I simply ask them to write the extra weight which I check each time and go to pay to the counter. The officer in the counter is also surprised as this is not very common.

I assumed that they were going to just put us together but still in the same row I didn’t even bother to look at the boarding pass and the reason I booked these seats was that I’ve just had a back operation and needed access to the isle.

There is something really wrong with how this low budget airline thinks when it comes to UX design and their Ethics on how they make money. It is incredible that I had booked a ticket for a short trip - 3 days for $270,000 Colombian pesos and ended up paying $600,000 in extras I ''somehow agreed''.  Instead of me activating all the additional expenses as a personal choice (Extra bag, Printing tickets, Express line, Insurance, etc) all those were by default activated for me. It was ''my responsibility'' to check in detail page after page and make sure all of those were unticked.  So after going through a process of reading carefully each page making sure you did not add by accident any additional unwanted and unnecessary additions, oh! surprised you ended up with a bill that is double the original ticket price. I understand you need to be careful when booking a low budget Ticket, but this is another level. This website was designed for people to make mistakes and then hide behind the Terms and Conditions policy making sure you pay for every single mistake made.  After my mistake I immediately called the call centre to try to rectify it ... to my surprise I was received by a call centre agent prepared to shoot me with all their policies, procedures, terms and conditions as a learned script. Turns out they do not offer any customer refunds. This airline receives hundreds of complaints of people experiencing similar issues on a daily basis. Calls like mine are their constant, as their tricks work and people end up confused and do not untick one, two, or all 6 extra unnecessary features. It is not ok to know you have a system that is designed this way and still have the guts to pick up the phone and blame it on the user. This makes me sad, angry and frustrated. If this review prevents you from making the same mistake of doing business with this sort of unethical business at least this frustration will have a purpose. Extras should be unticked and people should decide what to add. I don't go to the supermarket with a cart full of stuff and on the counter start selecting what I don't want to take with me.

"Viva Air";1;"'''excuse to keep their customers’ money.'''";"20th August 2020";"VERDADERO";"Viva Ar has recently cancelled my Lima-Cusco-Lima flights and issued me a voucher minus an administrative fee for the cancellation that they initiated! The voucher has a 180 day validity. They blame the Peruvian government's attempts to control the Covid-19 pandemic and completely ignored the following arguments: First, for Viva Air to charge an administrative fee for a cancellation that they have initiated is simply outrageous and in violation of standard airline practices. In fact, if an airline cancels flight because of bad weather or a disaster due to a tornado, for example, the standard and decent practice is to give customers a full refund for the moneys paid. The Covid-19 pandemic is actually worse than any weather disaster and a full refund is legitimately due. Second, for Viva Air to arbitrarily impose a 180 day limit on the use of the voucher under the uncertainties of the current pandemic conditions is not acceptable either. As the Peruvian experience of the last 5-6 months indicates, it s completely unpredictable when it would be possible for tourists to safely travel without risking their lives or well being. Specifically, there is no certainty about any of the following: (1) Whether some airports will be open or closed and when, and what other means of transportation will be available to tourists. In fact, air, train, and bus transportation has been prohibited for weeks, on and off, in most regions, provinces, and cities in Peru. (2) What travel restrictions will be imposed and what points of interests and attractions will be open or closed to the tourists. (3) What regions, provinces, or cities will be quarantined, when, and for how long. Not knowing this, tourists may be trapped in a quarantined place for weeks. (4) Peru is actually one of the countries with more severe problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic in South America. Thus, weekly repatriation flights for U.S. citizens and legal residents have been implemented since the pandemic started according to the U.S. Embassy in Lima and the State Department STEP (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program). This alone indicates that everything related to the Covid-19 pandemic is very unstable in Peru and it is impossible to plan any travel for an undetermined period of time. (5) How long the mandatory stay-at-home order for people 65 years old or older will last, or when it will be reinstated if lifted. This is something that may affect different regions, provinces, or cities at different times, imposing a severe displacement or travel restriction on any senior traveller or tourist. In fact, I am currently a 77 years old U.S. citizen and simply cannot travel under these circumstances. In brief, Viva Air owners and administrators are using the Peruvian government attempts to control the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to keep their customers’ money.

When returning home to Miami, the Viva Colombia Airline crew denied me taking the guitar and said I need to send it through with the bags. Of course, anyone that knows a Taylor Guitar is around $1,300 USD and it would insane to send it with a bunch of bags. I attempted to speak to the front desk staff who said no, spoke to her supervisor who did not even care or was a bit concerned about my problem. She said it was protocol to not take instruments as carry ons and that Viva Colombia in the States shouldn't have allowed me to bring it in. She apologized on behalf of their staff and just walked off. I called the person above her who was even more nonchalant about the situation, she could not have cared less.

I tried to use the self-service machine but couldn't get it to accept my eTicket number. Once check-in had opened a friendly agent spotted that I was only carrying hand baggage and pulled me out of the queue and successfully got me checked in using the s/s machine. Gate (03C) was announced about half an hour before boarding. Gate area is on ground floor directly opening onto the apron and was very poorly heated! Boarding was by bus to the aircraft at a stand. The plane a Fokker 50 was very cold on boarding but soon warmed up once the engines were started. Internally it looked a little tired but who cares on such a short trip? Seat pitch in row 8 was excellent. Inflight magazine said 32 inches but it felt more than that. Cabin crew did an excellent job of serving lunch (cheese or ham rolls) drinks and a chocolate to the quite full flight in the short time available (they also handed out boiled sweets before pushback). The flight continues from LCY to LUX and continuing passengers don't have to disembark - virtually everyone who boarded at MAN disembarked at LCY though. All in all a very pleasant experience. I usually only ever fly between Manchester and London at times like Christmas when there's no/poor train service but the convenient location of LCY for me (living in Kent) means that I would consider this route again - especially if I can't get a cheap advance ticket on the train in which case VLM's fares are often a quite reasonable alternative.";;;;;;;;;;;;;"no"

They did not want to fix my parking fees although CBX is stationed inside the airport. I did not take the voucher as I never plan to travel through CBX or Volaris. The airport representatives also treated the situation as a joke and continued to refer me to the airline. No one took responsibility for this terrible inconvenience.

We had our flight booked for Cancun to Portland from 2pm - 9pm on the 28th with a short layover in Guadalajara. To start, our first flight from Cancun was delayed 40 minutes, making us late to Guadalajara and our flight to Portland had already left before we arrived. The flight attendants did not know how to help us in the slightest, we were re-directed to several different employees all over the airport before finally being directed back to the main lobby and had to wait in line just to speak with the check in staff. When we were finally seen, the employee accused us of missing our flight and when we explained that it is was not our fault he told us the only available flight was the following day at 9:30am and that we would have to pay for an additional Covid-19 test before he could provide us with the boarding passes. I won't even get into how terrible the process was to get the test done. After, we returned to the check in desk for our boarding passes and had to wait 40 minutes before being seen again. A different employee helped us this second time and again insisted it was our fault that our flight was missed, this person barely spoke English and had to translate through text (which was fine, as long as we got through) however, he kept walking away from the desk to ask a coworker questions and obviously was having trouble getting our flight figured out. Once he was finally able to do so we were told that we would not be able to check our luggage in until the following morning, mind you this at 7pm. So in addition to having to wait 14 hours for our flight home we were not permitted into the departure area we had to wait in the airport entrance in a Burger King lobby until the following morning. We got up early to make sure we were ahead of the line and even the at 3am the Volaris check in was packed of people and it still took us an hour to get checked in.

"Volaris";1;"'''this is how our system works'''";"13th April 2022";"FALSO";"'  My friends bought flights to come visit me. Volaris boasts of having cheaper flights but you have to pay for your seat and either have to pay for an upgraded ticket if you want baggage OR pay for your carrying on and checked baggage. If you have to cancel your flight (due to COVID for instance, which is what happened to my friends), they only give you vouchers for the flight costs (not seat, not baggage, not taxes, so you lose all that money). If you bought a round trip, they split the money you paid into one voucher for your flight to the location and one voucher for your flight back from the location so that they are equal amounts. When you go to buy your new flights (that you have to purchase within 90 days), you have to buy the flight there separately from the flight back. This means that if your flight there is more expensive than your voucher, you have to pay the difference (so my friends have to pay over 100$ extra each for a family of three for their flight to Mexico). If your flight back is cheaper than your voucher, you lose all of that money (which for my friends is more than 100$). So they are losing over $300 more in addition to their seat and baggage and having to pay over $300 dollars more! When you call to talk to the people they basically say ''this is how our system works.'' When you ask for a higher up they take your number.

"Vueling Airlines";1;"'''don't expect any customer service to help you'''";"20th July 2023";"VERDADERO";"I can't comment on the quality of a Vueling flight because we never got off the ground. When we arrived at SCQ Spain airport on 18/6/23 we found our 18.15 flight to Gatwick was delayed. After a long wait finally the boarding time came up as 20.10hrs, but still boarding wasn't started for around half an hour later. Everyone is now sitting on board the plane luggage in overhead lockers, doors closed when an announcement is made that the staff have now been working for too many hours and the flight is cancelled!! Wouldn't they know that before we got on the plane? We are told to get off the plane and that someone on the first floor would help us. There was someone there, but they knew nothing and didn't know what to tell everyone, they soon disappeared. Every now and then a staff member would appear and the plane load of 200 plus people would converge on them demanding to know what was going on, but still they couldn't tell us anything! This went on till around 22.30hrs gradually people started slipping away as they were getting sick of waiting around they were making their own arrangements for accommodation and travel. We were told by some people who managed to speak to a staff member that they could not offer us another flight to our destination till 23/6/23 five days after we were meant to be there! Exhausted and sick of no helpful answers we gave up waiting, booked our own accommodation that night arriving there starving hungry after 2300hrs. Fortunately someone had the sense to start a WhatsApp group for passengers before people left so we could find out what other people were experiencing. Some people who stayed around and refused to leave had their accommodation that night arranged and paid for them including breakfast, but they didn't get in till around 0100hrs. That should have been offered to everyone immediately. We ended up catching a bus to Porto the next day and flying with another airline the morning after that, so we had to pay for another night's accommodation in Porto. Our travel agent has applied for a refund of our tickets, but there has been none so far 4 weeks later. I applied for EU compensation through Vueling which has been paid. I also applied to Vueling for reimbursement of our accommodation on the night of the cancellation as well as the bus we took to Porto, and the 2 nights lost accommodation in the UK as these were costs we incurred as a direct result of the flight cancellation. They have reimbursed me for the accommodation on the night of the cancellation only so am trying to recoup the rest on travel insurance.

I booked through Norwegian and the flights were operated by Wamos. I'll never make the mistake of ignoring that again. To begin with, the seats are massively uncomfortable. I wasn't expecting luxury, but I could actually feel how the plastic fit together through the seat cover on this flight. Additionally, the cost of food was $45, so I chose not to order food, opting instead to bring snacks on the plane. Both flights I took were transatlantic, so around 8-9 hours. If you had not paid for food, they would not allow you to have even water. actually saw the flight attendants laugh in other passengers' faces when they asked for a cup of water on an 8+ hour flight! One of these flights didn't even allow passengers a chance to purchase snacks or drinks, either. The gate agents weighed passengers carry-on baggage when they felt like it (in other words, arbitrarily), so some people with overweight luggage were allowed on regardless of weight, while others had to pay £80 to check their luggage at the gate. My flight from London to Chicago took off over 2 and a half hours late and nearly caused me to miss my next flight. The crew were in no rush to help passengers move quickly off the plane, even knowing that there were people with layovers who would now need to make connecting flights with drastically less time (including going through customs, awaiting baggage, transferring to domestic terminals, and going through security again.) I would rather pay a massive last-minute ticket price than ever ride with this airline again and if I ever find myself in a position to fly with them again, I would either spend the money for a different airline, or just stay home.";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"Gatwick to Chicago";2019-01-07 00:00:00;10;10;;10;20;;10;"no"

In summary of our experience do not fly Wings Air to get to your destination, particularly if you are a surfer. Cost for surfboards. The cost is Rp 200 000 per surfboard per flight. This means that flying from Bali to Sumbawa, which entailed two flights connecting in Lombok, cost Rp400 000 per board each way. We could not find this information anywhere on the Wings Air/Lion Air website, which of course would have informed our choice of airline. The Wings Air employee at check-in at Denpasar told us that the cost is indeed not on their website. Treatment of checked in surfboards - My brother paid Rp 1 200 000 for three surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. His board case was left in Lombok and involved considerable time and hassle to get back in Bali. I paid Rp 800 000 for two surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. One of my boards arrived with damage. Communication - We first attempted to travel from Bali to Sumbawa Besar on Monday 18/7/16. There were legitimate reasons for flights to be delayed that day – some repairs were being made to the runway. The level of frustration and angst at the gates being used by Wings Air was fuelled by a lack of communication and miscommunication.

When 6:45pm came we went to the gate to check what was happening to be told that our flight (and our surfboards) had already left at 5.10pm. A number of other passengers were also left stranded by this action. We went to the Wings Air/Lion Air office to work out how we could now get to Sumbawa Besar, and how we could ensure the security of our four surf bags with 11 surf boards.

To pay we had to wait at another counter with a huge queue and then back to the first counter to check in, where now only two employees (one of them extremely rude) served the 400 people who were anxiously waiting to catch their flight. While we were waiting, in the queue we realized that many of our fellow passengers had also fallen victim to the same fraud. To top off all the hassle and the charge of 90 Eur (2 people) was the additional delay of the flight for about an hour.

So we had to run to another terminal to pay - at which time there was 5 minutes left before the flight. When we asked how to get to the terminal, it was listed at the other terminal (3) (which was a good distance away) but the Wizz Air employee told us it was terminal 4. There were other customers from all over the world (Irish, Portuguese) who had the same problem. At this stage in the game I insisted they show us where we should go.

When i booked this trip, there were a few other airline options that were a little more expensive. Knowing what i know now, i should have picked any other airline. Never again for me.

"XL Airways France";1;"'''Worst experience ever!'''";"11th August 2017";"FALSO";"'  San Francisco to Paris CDG. Worst experience ever! My husband's legs (lean built - 5 foot 9 inch) wouldn't fit in! His legs bent sideways. This has never happened in any economy class flights. Vegetarian meal is considered a ''special'' meal. Its an additional $14 per person. There is extra charge for every little thing ($3-$15) for snacks, soft drinks, chips, cookies etc. Additional charge to book seats beforehand. Husband paid $75 extra to sit in ''exit'' row. Cabin crew was nice and friendly but a smiley face doesn't alleviate the extreme discomfort. Long lines to get boarding pass. We were in line for an 1 hour 10 minutes even though we reached airport 3 hours early. No seat back TV/screens. No plug point to charge phone/ tablet.'";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"San Francisco to Paris CDG";2017-01-06 00:00:00;10;50;10;10;10;10;10;"no"
"XL Airways France";1;"'''no service whatsoever'''";"30th June 2016";"FALSO";"Flew XL Airways France from Paris CDG to Miami. The price could not be beat, but you get what you pay for. After they served the meal, about an hour into the flight, all of the flight attendants disappeared for 4 hours. People kept pressing the call buttons and nobody showed up. I kept pressing mine and someone would turn it off after a little while, no service whatsoever. They will not bring you water, you have to get up and get it yourself in the middle area. They don't have TVs but offer tablet rentals. I tried to rent one but they only had 20 or so for the entire flight, so with only a few people ahead of me for one, I didn't get one. I had to sit there bored for 9 hours. Your flight comes with nothing, you have to pay for everything, including snacks, and a blanket. They have outlets under the seats but they don't work, nobody's outlet worked.";;"Solo Leisure";"Economy Class";"CDG to MIA";2016-01-06 00:00:00;30;10;10;10;;;30;"no"
"XL Airways France";2;"XL Airways France customer review";"13th July 2015";"FALSO";"This airline offers cheap flights to Paris but, you get what you paid for. I took a round trip flight from NY to Paris in July 2015, and it was one of the worst experiences I have had. The airplanes I took were old model, they did not have TV's, they had monitors. Because the planes were so old, the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There is no option to push your seat back because there was no space! Even if you had that option, it would be almost cruel to the person sitting behind you. I am 5’1 and my knees were almost touching the seat in the front. So if you are taller than 5’3, the economy ticket of this airline is not for you. I had to stand up a few times during the flight in order to have some blood circulation though my legs. Also, if you are a person who likes air conditioning, their planes are room temperature. Meaning, for me, it was hot throughout the whole flight. The food was decent, but the flight attendants were rude. You are only allowed to get water or coffee with your meal, for everything else, you have to pay extra. $4 for a can of coke! Overall, it was a nightmare for me, mostly because I was so uncomfortable, spending 8 hours in a hot small space was not pretty. So if you have the money to pay a little extra and have a better experience, do it.";;"Family Leisure";"Economy Class";"New York to Paris";2015-01-07 00:00:00;10;10;30;10;10;10;30;"no"

"ZIPAIR";1;"'''$300 savings was absolutely not worth it'''";"22nd July 2022";"VERDADERO";"'  My issues started before we even flew. I recovered from Covid but was still testing positive for over a week. Had to get a letter from the Japanese Consulate. At first Zipair said they don't know if they can accept it and to email a copy in. So I emailed a copy and was told they won't accept it. So I called overseas to their Japan HQ and the people there said ''They might accept it at LAX, try your luck''. No I am not going to try my luck. 12 hours before before my flight was to leave they send me an email saying they can accept the consulate paper. Ridiculous that they are so disorganized. Check-in was easy but their online support said they will add TSA precheck when we check-in. At check-in they refused to do so. On the flight you are only given 1 meal, if you paid in advance and 1 bottle of water - it's barely a snack even to Japanese. You are also given the food 1 hour after boarding so enjoy 10 hours of nothing. You will get no more food, water, etc. If you want anything else you have to order it via your phone connected to their in-flight wifi. I ordered a coffee, cost about $2.50 and was brought in a very small cup.  At least when you order snacks they do come fast. In-flight entertainment didn't exist. The system worked on the ground but the second it was airborne all entertainment didn't work. So bring your own movies and entertainment. The seats were clear and nice. Felt the same as any other airline but it certainly was cleaner. The $300 savings was absolutely not worth it.

I booked flights to go from Singapore to Tokyo and due to unforeseen circumstances I have been really unwell and aren’t allowed to fly. I reached out to zipair and advised the situation and the medical advise I was given. I requested a voucher or refund and will fly with them again when i can. The operator advised I would be only receiving $50 (AUD) from a $550 (AUD) refund because HQ would give anything else (exact words) I was dumbfounded that that was the response. Not even with a medical certificate would they assist with situation. I am out of pocket $500 due to something I have no control over. I wish i could honestly fly with them, Its a planned holiday but I am physically unable.
