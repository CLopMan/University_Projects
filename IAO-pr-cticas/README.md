# IAO-pr-cticas
This repository contains the projects developed for _Artificial Intelligence for Bussines_ course.

## Practica 1
Developed a total of 32 RNA models using Altair AI Studio, following two approaches for processing Spanish reservoir data:
- Process the data as a non-time-related series.
- Process the data as a time-related series.

The best models from each approach were used to predict the water level for the next 3 weeks of a reservoir.

## Practica 2

Developed a total of 25 models using Altair AI Studio, following three different
approaches for classifying flight reviews:
- Process non-textual data.
- Process exclusively textual data
- Process exclusively textual data using sentiment analysis and n-grams.

In addition, the data was also analyzed using *topic modelling*.

## Practica3

Develop a MATLAB-based fuzzy logic system to evaluate properties with a focus on student-centered criteria.
