# PL-practicaFinal
This project aims to create a program that translates a subset of the C programming language to Forth, with Lisp serving as an intermediate language. It also accepts some embed code using the structure `//@<lisp code>` or `//@//@<forth code>`.

The project was developed during several weeks. You can check the final programm in the "final" folder. 

Course: third (2023-2024)
## Requirements
The project was developed using [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) version 3.8.2 and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version 13.3.1.

In addition, [CLisp](https://clisp.sourceforge.io/) and [Gforth](https://gforth.org/) were used as interpreters of Lisp and Forth language.

## How to use the program
Althoug some bash scripts were included for running tests, the general use of this project is the following: 
1. Compile the translator either using `make` or compiling through the following commands: 
```
bison back.y
bison trad.y
gcc -g -Wall trad.tab.c -o trad
gcc -g -Wall back.tab.c -o back
```
2. Translate: 
```
./trad < your_c_code.c | ./back
```
## Running test
Several test can be run using two bash scripts included in `Desarrollo/cuartaParte`. In order to execute `runall.sh` please make sure there are just `.c` files in `myTest/frontend` and `tests` folders. You can do this by executing `clear.sh`. Some tests provided by the professor present permisions issues, so you may need to run this script with `sudo`. After running `runall.sh` you can check the output of the program in the same folder where the tests are stored.

The execution of the tests using these scripts also tries to evaluate the output code with Clisp and Gforth. Make sure you have this two programms in your computer before running them. If not, you will get an error, but you will also be able to check the code generated by the program.
