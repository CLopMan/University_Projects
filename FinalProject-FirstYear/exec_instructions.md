# Recommendations 
If you have a newer version of python (e.g. python 3.10) this project may not work. You can run easily this project using a virtual enviroment:
1. Install python3.8 on your computer running a command similar to `sudo dnf install python3.8` (fedora) or `sudo apt-install python3.8`(ubuntu)
  - You may need to adjust that command to your OS
2. Create your virtual enviroment by running the command `python3.8 -m venv myenv`
3. Run your virtual enviroment: (from the project's directory) `. myenv/bin/activate`. 
  - Now you should have activated the virtual enviroment. You can checkit by looking at the command line, it must look like `(myenv) user@path$`
4. install pyxel: `pip install pyxel==1.4.3`
5. Run main.py: `python3.8 main.py`
