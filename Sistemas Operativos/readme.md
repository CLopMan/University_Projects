# Context
During second year of college, we studied about how Operative Systems works. Thus, we develop 3 projects:
- p1: we have to implement our versions of POXIX commands env, ls and wc
- p2: we have to implement our own minishell. We were given the parser and basic functionality like time count. 
- p3: we have to implement a queue-gestor for bank operations applying our concurrent-programming knowledge.
